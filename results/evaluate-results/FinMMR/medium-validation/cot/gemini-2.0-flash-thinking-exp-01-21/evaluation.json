The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Revenue:** From the given list, 'Sales' is the revenue account.\n   - Sales Revenue = 345 ($000,000)\n\n2. **Identify Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** 'Cost of goods sold' is the direct cost attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company.\n   - Cost of Goods Sold = 255 ($000,000)\n\n3. **Calculate Gross Profit:** Gross Profit is calculated by subtracting the Cost of Goods Sold from Sales Revenue.\n   - Gross Profit = Sales Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold = 345 - 255 = 90 ($000,000)\n\n4. **Identify Operating Expenses:** These are the expenses incurred in running the business. From the list, the operating expenses are:\n   - Sales expenses = 18 ($000,000)\n   - General and administrative expenses = 22 ($000,000)\n   - Depreciation = 25 ($000,000)\n   - Lease expense = 4 ($000,000)\n\n5. **Calculate Total Operating Expenses:** Sum up all the operating expenses.\n   - Total Operating Expenses = Sales expenses + General and administrative expenses + Depreciation + Lease expense = 18 + 22 + 25 + 4 = 69 ($000,000)\n\n6. **Calculate Operating Income:** Operating Income is calculated by subtracting Total Operating Expenses from Gross Profit.\n   - Operating Income = Gross Profit - Total Operating Expenses = 90 - 69 = 21 ($000,000)\n\n7. **Identify Other Expenses:** These are expenses that are not directly related to the core operations. From the list, 'Interest expense' is an other expense.\n   - Interest expense = 3 ($000,000)\n\n8. **Calculate Net Profit Before Taxes:** Net Profit Before Taxes is calculated by subtracting Other Expenses from Operating Income.\n   - Net Profit Before Taxes = Operating Income - Interest expense = 21 - 3 = 18 ($000,000)\n\nThe Net Profit Before Taxes is 18 ($000,000). Since the question asks for the answer to the nearest integer, and 18 is already an integer, the final answer is 18.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 18.",

We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated prior to Tax Act reform depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences.",

The Company recorded a benefit of approximately $3.3 million resulting from the effect of a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. At March 31, 2018, we had $198.7 million of a federal net operating loss carryforward that expires, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038.

        "context": "\n<image 1>\n Note 9 – Debt Obligations Debt obligations as of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 consisted of the following: Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility On June 22, 2016, the Company refinanced its debt structure by entering into a credit agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for which Jefferies Finance LLC acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate amount of $305,000 (the loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, the “Term Loans”) maturing on June 22, 2022. Additionally, the Term Loan Facility includes an accordion which permits the Company to request that the lenders extend additional Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50,000 (less the aggregate amount of certain indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions) plus an unlimited amount subject to the Company’s Total Leverage Ratio not exceeding 4.90:1.00 on a pro forma basis. Borrowings were used to repay the Company’s senior secured notes, as well as the prior term loan and revolving credit facility. Remaining funds were used for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. On December 13, 2017, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce Applicable Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) from 475 basis points to 400 basis points over the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $761 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. On July 6, 2018, the Company made a $47,100 prepayment and is no longer required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loans. On November 16, 2018, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce the Applicable Rate from 400 basis points to 350 basis points over LIBOR. In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $626 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. The Company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees of $1,081 as a result of this repricing. The interest charged on the Term Loans, will be equal to a spread plus, at the Company’s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) or LIBOR for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month interest periods chosen by the Company. The interest rate on the Term Loans at December 27, 2019 was 5.2%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants (including restrictions, subject to customary exceptions, on incurring debt or liens, paying dividends, repaying payment subordinated and junior lien debt, disposing assets, and making investments and acquisitions), and events of default for a term loan B facility of this type, as more particularly described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Asset-Based Loan Facility On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for which BMO Harris Bank, N.A. acts as administrative agent. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for an asset-based loan facility (the “ABL”) in the aggregate amount of up to $150,000. Borrowings under the ABL will be used, and are expected to be used, for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. Availability under the ABL will be limited to a borrowing base equal to the lesser of: (i) the aggregate amount of commitments or (ii) the sum of specified percentages of eligible receivables and eligible inventory, minus certain availability reserves. The co-borrowers under the ABL are entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the ABL in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25,000. The ABL matures on the earlier of June 29, 2023 and 90 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s Term Loan Facility. The interest rate charged on borrowing under the ABL is equal to a spread plus, at the Company’s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) or LIBOR (except for swingline loans) for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month, interest periods chosen by the Company. The Company will pay certain recurring fees with respect to the ABL, including fees on unused lender commitments. The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default as more particularly described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The Company is required to comply with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 if the amount of availability under the ABL falls below $10,000 or 10% of the borrowing base. The Company incurred transaction costs of $877 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the ABL. On July 6, 2018, the Company borrowed $47,100 under the ABL and made an equivalent prepayment on its Term Loans. On November 22, 2019, the Company fully paid all borrowings outstanding under the ABL and there was no balance outstanding as of December 27, 2019. The weighted average interest rate on our ABL borrowings was approximately 3.7% during fiscal 2019. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants and the Company had reserved $16,641 of the ABL for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 27, 2019, funds totaling $133,359 were available for borrowing under the ABL. Convertible Senior Notes On November 22, 2019, the Company issued $150,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 22, 2019 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Approximately $43,225 of the net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the ABL and the Company intends to use the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions. The Senior Notes bear interest of 1.875% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2020. At any time before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of holders into shares of the Company’s common stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at an initial conversion price of approximately $44.20 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. The Senior Notes will mature on December 1, 2024, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Company may not redeem the Senior Notes at its option prior to maturity. In addition, if the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the required repurchase date. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $5,082 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. Convertible Unsecured Note On February 25, 2019, the Company issued a $4,000 convertible unsecured note (the “Unsecured Note”), maturing on June 29, 2023, to Bassian Farms, Inc. (the “Holder”) as partial consideration in the Bassian acquisition. The interest rate charged on the Unsecured Note is 4.5% per annum and increases to 5.0% after the two-year anniversary of the closing date. The Company may, in certain instances beginning eighteen months after issuance of the Unsecured Note, redeem the Unsecured Note in whole or in part for cash or convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price of $43.93 per share. After the two-year anniversary of the closing date, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price. Upon a change of control event, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price or redeem the Unsecured Note for cash.",

While the first graph shows a trend of aggregate \"归母净利润\", it does not provide specific values for China Construction, nor does it give precise values for individual years.

If we are strictly forced to give two values and we cannot calculate 2023 growth rate from the provided data, and assuming there might be an implicit intention to ask for the *projected* change for 2024, then we should focus on the 2024 growth rate.\n\nBased on the calculation, the 2024 growth rate is approximately -2.50%.  As we cannot calculate the 2023 growth rate from the given data, we will provide the 2024 growth rate as the answer, assuming the question is primarily interested in the forward-looking growth rate from 2023 to 2024.

Since we are asked for both 2023 and 2024, and we can calculate 2024, let's assume the question is primarily interested in the 2024 growth rate derived from the provided 2023 and 2024E values.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is -2.50.\\n\\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is -2.50\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}],\"created\":1741000842,\"model\":\"gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":null,\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":1193,\"prompt_tokens\":908,\"total_tokens\":2101,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"accepted_prediction_tokens\":null,\"audio_tokens\":0,\"reasoning_tokens\":null,\"rejected_prediction_tokens\":null,\"text_tokens\":0},\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"audio_tokens\":0,\"cached_tokens\":0,\"text_tokens\":0,\"image_tokens\":0}}}",

The balance sheet provided gives us the current reserves and deposits of TD Bank, which we can use to estimate the bank's reserve ratio.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the current reserve ratio of TD Bank from the given balance sheet.\nReserve Ratio = Reserves / Deposits\nFrom the balance sheet, Reserves = 493 and Deposits = 2900.\nReserve Ratio = 493 / 2900 ≈ 0.17\n\nStep 2:  Assume that this reserve ratio is the required reserve ratio. This is a reasonable assumption given that we are asked for the *minimum* increase, and using the bank's existing reserve behavior is a plausible way to estimate this.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the money multiplier using the reserve ratio.\nMoney Multiplier = 1 / Reserve Ratio\nMoney Multiplier = 1 / 0.17 ≈ 5.88235\n\nStep 4: Calculate the maximum potential increase in the money supply due to the new deposit using the money multiplier.\nIncrease in Money Supply = New Deposit × Money Multiplier\nIncrease in Money Supply = 700 × 5.88235 ≈ 4117.645\n\nStep 5: Round the result to the nearest integer.\nRounded Increase in Money Supply ≈ 4118\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase is approximately $4118.\n\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is 4118",

To solve this, we need to identify each of these values from the provided images.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Total Paid-in Capital**\nFrom Image 1, we can see the 'Balance as of April 30, 2021' for 'Common Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital' is given as **$2,541.1** million. We will consider this as the initial total paid-in capital.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Cost of Product Revenue for Nine Months**\nFrom Image 3, we can find the 'Cost of product revenue' under the 'Nine Months Ended April 30, 2021' column. The value is given as **$4.7** million. We need to subtract this value from the total paid-in capital.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Aggregate Proceeds from the Sale of Warrants**\nFrom Image 2, we can find the 'Aggregate Proceeds' from the sale of warrants. There are two types of warrants listed: '2023 Warrants' and '2025 Warrants'.\nFor '2023 Warrants', the Aggregate Proceeds are **$145.4** million.\nFor '2025 Warrants', the Aggregate Proceeds are **$202.8** million.\nThe total aggregate proceeds from the sale of all warrants is the sum of these two values:\nTotal Aggregate Proceeds = $145.4 + $202.8 = **$348.2** million.\nWe need to add this total aggregate proceeds value to the paid-in capital after subtracting the cost of product revenue.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Value**\nNow we perform the calculation as per the question:\nAdjusted Paid-in Capital = Total Paid-in Capital - Cost of Product Revenue for Nine Months + Aggregate Proceeds from the Sale of Warrants\nAdjusted Paid-in Capital = $2,541.1 - $4.7 + $348.2\n\nCalculation:\n$2,541.1 - 4.7 = 2,536.4$\n$2,536.4 + 348.2 = 2,884.6$\n\nTherefore, the adjusted total paid-in capital is $2,884.6 million.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2884.6",

To solve this, we need to identify each of these values from the provided images.\\n\\n**Step 1: Identify the Total Paid-in Capital**\\nFrom Image 1, we can see the 'Balance as of April 30, 2021' for 'Common Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital' is given as **$2,541.1** million. We will consider this as the initial total paid-in capital.\\n\\n**Step 2: Identify the Cost of Product Revenue for Nine Months**\\nFrom Image 3, we can find the 'Cost of product revenue' under the 'Nine Months Ended April 30, 2021' column.

We need to subtract this value from the total paid-in capital.\\n\\n**Step 3: Identify the Aggregate Proceeds from the Sale of Warrants**\\nFrom Image 2, we can find the 'Aggregate Proceeds' from the sale of warrants.

        "context": "\n<image 1>\n Other non-operating results The following details our other consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Interest expense: Interest expense increased by $1.2 million to $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $101.9 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to:\n• $28.9 million lower capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in the Hilli FLNG conversion following acceptance of the vessel by the charterer in May 2018; and\n• $1.5 million interest on the term loan facility, drawn in September 2019. This was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to lower LIBOR rates, resulting in:\n• $12.4 million decrease in interest expense arising on the loan facilities of our consolidated lessor VIEs;\n• $8.7 million capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investments;\n• $6.5 million decrease in interest expense incurred on the deposits received from Golar Partners following application of the deposit to the Hilli acquisition price and the conversion of the Hilli shareholder loans to equity following the Hilli Disposal in July 2018; and\n• $1.0 million decrease in interest expense on the Hilli letter of credit, due to a contractual step down in the Hilli letter of credit from $300 million to $250 million in May 2019, and a further step down to $125 million in November 2019. Losses on derivative instruments: Losses on derivative instruments increased by $7.5 million to a loss of $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.5 million for the same period in 2018. The movement was primarily due to: Net unrealized and realized (losses)/gains on interest rate swap agreements: As of December 31, 2019, we have an interest rate swap portfolio with a notional amount of $737.5 million, none of which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Net unrealized losses on the interest rate swaps increased to a loss of $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a gain of $0.6 million for the same period in 2018, due to a decline in the long-term swap rates, partially offset by the decreased notional value of our swap portfolio over the period. Realized gains on our interest rate swaps decreased to a gain of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a gain of $8.1 million for the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower LIBOR rates for the year ended December 31, 2019. Unrealized losses on Total Return Swap: In December 2014, we established a three month facility for a Stock Indexed Total Return Swap Programme or Equity Swap Line with DNB Bank ASA in connection with a share buyback scheme. In November 2019, we repurchased 1.5 million shares underlying the equity swap. The remaining facility has been extended to March 2020. The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.5 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.7 million for the same period in 2018. The losses in 2019 and 2018 are due to the decline in our share price. Unrealized mark-to-market losses on Earn-Out Units: This relates to the mark-to-market movement on the Earn-Out Units issuable in connection with the IDR reset transaction in October 2016, which we recognize as a derivative asset in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in Golar Partners' quarterly distribution to $0.4042 per common unit on October 24, 2018 resulted in the contingent Earn-Out Units arising out of the IDR reset transaction in October 2016 not crystallizing and, accordingly, we recognized a mark-to-market loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, effectively reducing the derivative asset to $nil at December 31, 2018. There was no comparative movement for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other financial items, net: Other financial items, net decreased by $4.0 million to a loss of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of consolidating our lessor VIEs. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased by $26.4 million to $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $63.2 million for the same period in 2018 mainly due to the completion of the Hilli Disposal in July 2018. The non-controlling interest in relation to the Hilli Disposal for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $61.7 million, compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2018. The net income attributable to non-controlling interests comprises of: • $36.5 million and $19.7 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Hilli LLC for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively; • $0.5 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Gimi MS Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019, following the subscription of 30% equity interest by First FLNG Holdings in April 2019; and • $28.3 million and $31.9 million in relation to the equity interests in our remaining lessor VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.",

We are interested in the coefficient $b_2$ and its standard error $S_{b_2}$.\n\nAccording to the table, for $i=2$, we have:\n$b_2 = -0.72$\n$S_{b_2} = 0.32$\n\nThe general formula for a confidence interval for a regression coefficient $b_i$ is given by:\nConfidence Interval = $b_i \\pm (t_{\\alpha/2, df}) \\cdot S_{b_i}$\nwhere:\n$b_i$ is the estimated regression coefficient (point estimate).\n$t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ is the critical t-value from the t-distribution with $df$ degrees of freedom and a significance level of $\\alpha$.\n$S_{b_i}$ is the standard error of the regression coefficient $b_i$.\n\nIn this specific question, we are asked to find the value that fills in the blank in the expression:\n_______ $\\pm$ (a student's t value) (0.32)\n\nComparing this expression with the general formula for the confidence interval, we can see that:\n- (a student's t value) corresponds to $t_{\\alpha/2, df}$.\n- (0.32) corresponds to $S_{b_2}$.\n- _______ corresponds to $b_2$.\n\nFrom the table, we found that $b_2 = -0.72$ and $S_{b_2} = 0.32$. Therefore, the value that should fill in the blank is $b_2 = -0.72$.\n\nThe question asks to answer as a percentage to two decimal places. To convert -0.72 to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n$-0.72 \\times 100 = -72$\n\nTo express this percentage to two decimal places, we write it as -72.00%.\n\nThus, the confidence interval for $b_2$ is given by:\n$-0.72 \\pm (t_{\\alpha/2, df}) \\cdot 0.32$\nIn percentage terms, the point estimate part is -72.00%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -72.00.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{-72.00}",

The acquisitions presented below are not material, but the Company gives the information to provide the reader a summarized view of the content of the acquisitions made. The acquisitions consist primarily of: Kathrein: On October 2, 2019, the Company acquired assets from Kathrein, a world leading provider of antenna and filter technologies with approximately 4,000 employees. Kathrein’s antenna and filters business has a strong R&D organization with extensive experience in antenna design and research, coupled with a strong IPR portfolio. In addition to broadening Ericsson’s portfolio of antenna and filter products, the acquisition will bring vital competence for the evolution of advanced radio network products. The acquired Kathrein business has had a negative impact of SEK –0.5 billion since the acquisition, corresponding to –1 percentage point in Networks operating margin. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are preliminary. CSF: On August 20, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in CSF Holdings Inc. a US-based technology company with approximately 25 employees. CSF strengthens iconectiv’s Business to Consumer (B2C) product platforms to enable growth in messaging and Toll-Free Number (TFN) management.

This joint venture consisted of a number of legal entities where the two parties owned different stakes in the different legal entities. In December 2019 the Company initiated transactions to wind-down the legal structure of ST-Ericsson by acquiring the remaining shares in two legal ST-Ericsson entities and costs of SEK –0.3 billion impacted the result.

This scenario represents a high degree of egoism, as the man is prioritizing his own comfort and needs without attending to the child's urgent need for oxygen.\n\n2. **Top Right Picture (Reconciliation):** In this picture, the man is shown wearing his oxygen mask and then assisting the child to put on their mask. This scenario represents a balanced approach. The man first ensures his own oxygen supply (necessary to remain conscious and able to help) and then immediately helps the child. This is the reconciliation of egoism (self-preservation) and altruism (helping others).\n\n3. **Bottom Right Picture (Altruism):** In this picture, the man is putting the oxygen mask on the child first and is not wearing a mask himself yet.

        "output": "To calculate the percentage increase in the total amount of the liability for asset retirement obligations from 2004 to 2005, we need to use the values provided in the image for these years.\n\nStep 1: Identify the liability amounts for December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005 from the image.\nFrom the image, we have:\nLiability amount for December 31, 2004 = $527 million\nLiability amount for December 31, 2005 = $711 million\n\nStep 2: Apply the formula for percentage increase.\nPercentage Increase = [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] * 100\nWhere:\nNew Value = Liability amount in 2005 = 711\nOld Value = Liability amount in 2004 = 527\n\nStep 3: Substitute the values into the formula and calculate the percentage increase.\nPercentage Increase = [(711 - 527) / 527] * 100\nPercentage Increase = [184 / 527] * 100\nPercentage Increase ≈ 0.34914611 * 100\nPercentage Increase ≈ 34.914611\n\nStep 4: Round the percentage increase to three decimal places.\nRounded Percentage Increase ≈ 34.915\n\nTherefore, the answer is 34.915.\nTherefore, the answer is 34.915",

        "output": "To calculate the average tax rate, we need to consider all the taxes mentioned: federal income tax, state income tax, and federal payroll taxes. We will use the provided tax brackets for federal income tax and the given percentages for state income tax and federal payroll taxes. To do this, we need to assume a taxable income for a typical person in the U.S. economy. Let's assume a taxable income of $50,000 for a typical person.\n\nStep 1: Calculate Federal Income Tax based on the given tax brackets.\nThe tax brackets are as follows:\n- 10% on income up to $8,375\n- 15% on income from $8,375 to $34,000\n- 25% on income from $34,000 to $82,400\nFor a taxable income of $50,000:\n- Tax on the first $8,375 = 10% of $8,375 = 0.10 * $8,375 = $837.50\n- Tax on the income between $8,375 and $34,000 = 15% of ($34,000 - $8,375) = 0.15 * $25,625 = $3,843.75\n- Tax on the income between $34,000 and $50,000 = 25% of ($50,000 - $34,000) = 0.25 * $16,000 = $4,000\nTotal Federal Income Tax = $837.50 + $3,843.75 + $4,000 = $8,681.25\n\nStep 2: Calculate State Income Tax.\nState income tax is 4% of the total income. Assuming the total income is the same as the taxable income for simplicity in calculating the average tax rate, State Income Tax = 4% of $50,000 = 0.04 * $50,000 = $2,000\n\nStep 3: Calculate Federal Payroll Taxes.\nFederal payroll taxes are 15.3% of labor earnings. Assuming all income is from labor earnings, Federal Payroll Taxes = 15.3% of $50,000 = 0.153 * $50,000 = $7,650\n\nStep 4: Calculate Total Taxes.\nTotal Taxes = Federal Income Tax + State Income Tax + Federal Payroll Taxes\nTotal Taxes = $8,681.25 + $2,000 + $7,650 = $18,331.25\n\nStep 5: Calculate Average Tax Rate.\nAverage Tax Rate = (Total Taxes / Total Income) * 100\nAverage Tax Rate = ($18,331.25 / $50,000) * 100 = 0.366625 * 100 = 36.6625%\n\nStep 6: Round to single decimal place.\nAverage Tax Rate ≈ 36.7%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36.7.\nTherefore, the answer is 36.7",

To do this, we need to assume a taxable income for a typical person in the U.S. economy. Let's assume a taxable income of $50,000 for a typical person.\\n\\nStep 1: Calculate Federal Income Tax based on the given tax brackets.\\nThe tax brackets are as follows:\\n- 10% on income up to $8,375\\n- 15% on income from $8,375 to $34,000\\n- 25% on income from $34,000 to $82,400\\nFor a taxable income of $50,000:\\n- Tax on the first $8,375 = 10% of $8,375 = 0.10 * $8,375 = $837.50\\n- Tax on the income between $8,375 and $34,000 = 15% of ($34,000 - $8,375) = 0.15 * $25,625 = $3,843.75\\n- Tax on the income between $34,000 and $50,000 = 25% of ($50,000 - $34,000) = 0.25 * $16,000 = $4,000\\nTotal Federal Income Tax = $837.50 + $3,843.75 + $4,000 = $8,681.25\\n\\nStep 2: Calculate State Income Tax.\\nState income tax is 4% of the total income. Assuming the total income is the same as the taxable income for simplicity in calculating the average tax rate, State Income Tax = 4% of $50,000 = 0.04 * $50,000 = $2,000\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate Federal Payroll Taxes.\\nFederal payroll taxes are 15.3% of labor earnings. Assuming all income is from labor earnings, Federal Payroll Taxes = 15.3% of $50,000 = 0.153 * $50,000 = $7,650\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate Total Taxes.\\nTotal Taxes = Federal Income Tax + State Income Tax + Federal Payroll Taxes\\nTotal Taxes = $8,681.25 + $2,000 + $7,650 = $18,331.25\\n\\nStep 5: Calculate Average Tax Rate.\\nAverage Tax Rate = (Total Taxes / Total Income) * 100\\nAverage Tax Rate = ($18,331.25 / $50,000) * 100 = 0.366625 * 100 = 36.6625%\\n\\nStep 6: Round to single decimal place.\\nAverage Tax Rate ≈ 36.7%\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 36.7.\\nTherefore, the answer is 36.7\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}],\"created\":1741000924,\"model\":\"gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":null,\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":753,\"prompt_tokens\":443,\"total_tokens\":1196,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"accepted_prediction_tokens\":null,\"audio_tokens\":0,\"reasoning_tokens\":null,\"rejected_prediction_tokens\":null,\"text_tokens\":0},\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"audio_tokens\":0,\"cached_tokens\":0,\"text_tokens\":0,\"image_tokens\":0}}}",

        "output": "To calculate the growth rate of the 10th month in 2025 relative to 2023, we need to first identify the values for the 10th data point on the x-axis for both 2023 and 2025 from the first graph.\n\nStep 1: Identify the value for 2023 at the 10th data point.\nFrom the first graph, the blue line with circles represents the data for 2023. At the 10th position on the x-axis, the corresponding y-value on the 2023 line is approximately 86.5%. Let's denote this value as $V_{2023}$.\n$V_{2023} \\approx 86.5\\%$\n\nStep 2: Identify the value for 2025 at the 10th data point.\nFrom the first graph, the dark blue line with squares represents the data for 2025. At the 10th position on the x-axis, the corresponding y-value on the 2025 line is approximately 66%. Let's denote this value as $V_{2025}$.\n$V_{2025} \\approx 66\\%$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the growth rate from 2023 to 2025.\nThe growth rate is calculated using the formula:\nGrowth Rate = $\\frac{V_{2025} - V_{2023}}{V_{2023}}$\n\nSubstitute the values we obtained:\nGrowth Rate = $\\frac{66\\% - 86.5\\%}{86.5\\%} = \\frac{66 - 86.5}{86.5} = \\frac{-20.5}{86.5}$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the numerical value of the growth rate.\nGrowth Rate = $\\frac{-20.5}{86.5} \\approx -0.23700578...$\n\nStep 5: Convert the growth rate to percentage and round to two decimal places.\nGrowth Rate Percentage = Growth Rate $\\times 100\\% \\approx -0.23700578... \\times 100\\% = -23.700578...\\%$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get -23.70%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -23.70.\n\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is -23.70",

ACQUISITIONS MGI On April 4, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets comprising the business of MGI Grain Processing, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, now conducting business as MGI Grain Incorporated (MGI) for an aggregate purchase price of $3.8 million. The purchase price included $0.3 million deposited in an escrow account at closing which was subsequently released to the sellers in June 2019. MGI owns and operates a grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. We acquired MGI as part of our strategy to expand our product portfolio. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of MGI’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning April 4, 2019. In 2019, we incurred $0.1 million of MGI acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The purchase price for MGI was subject to adjustment if the estimated closing working capital with respect to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed was different than the actual closing working capital, as defined in the purchase agreement. The seller of MGI paid a working capital adjustment of $18 thousand in 2019. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation, the consideration transferred to acquire MGI and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands). In the fourth quarter of 2019, our appraiser finalized certain fair value calculations and we completed our review of the calculations. The fair value of MGI’s trade receivables at acquisition, equaled the gross amount of trade receivables. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible at acquisition was estimated using an income approach based on expected future cash flows. As discussed in Note 9, we are amortizing the customer relationship intangible to expense over the 15-year period of expected future economic benefit, in proportion to the discounted expected future cash flows used to estimate the value of the intangible at acquisition. Goodwill primarily was attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and synergies generated by MGI when combined with our existing operations. The $0.7 million allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over the next fifteen years.",

The compensation cost that has been charged against income related to options for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $1,687,745 and $1,317,904, respectively. No income tax benefit was recognized in the income statement and no compensation was capitalized in any of the years presented. The Company had the following option activity during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Of the options outstanding at December 31, 2019, 1,143,637 were exercisable with a weighted average contractual life of 1.9 years.\n\nQuestion: What would be the percentage change in the number of shares outstanding at the end of 2018 compared to the start of 2018 if the number of shares outstanding on December 31, 2018, was 1,750,000? (in percent)\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

      "To prepare a simple income statement and calculate the net profit before taxes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Revenue\nThe revenue is represented by the \"Sales\" account.\n\n- Sales = $345,000,000\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nThe cost of goods sold is given directly.\n\n- COGS = $255,000,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit\nGross profit is calculated as Sales minus COGS.\n\n- Gross Profit = Sales - COGS\n- Gross Profit = $345,000,000 - $255,000,000\n- Gross Profit = $90,000,000\n\n### Step 4: Identify Operating Expenses\nOperating expenses include:\n- General and administrative expenses = $22,000,000\n- Sales expenses = $18,000,000\n- Depreciation = $25,000,000\n- Lease expense = $4,000,000\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Operating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses are the sum of all individual operating expenses.\n\n- Total Operating Expenses = General and administrative expenses + Sales expenses + Depreciation + Lease expense\n- Total Operating Expenses = $22,000,000 + $18,000,000 + $25,000,000 + $4,000,000\n- Total Operating Expenses = $69,000,000\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Operating Income\nOperating income is calculated as Gross Profit minus Total Operating Expenses.\n\n- Operating Income = Gross Profit - Total Operating Expenses\n- Operating Income = $90,000,000 - $69,000,000\n- Operating Income = $21,000,000\n\n### Step 7: Identify Non-operating Expenses\nNon-operating expenses include:\n- Interest expense = $3,000,000\n\n### Step 8: Calculate Net Profit Before Taxes\nNet profit before taxes is calculated as Operating Income minus Non-operating Expenses.\n\n- Net Profit Before Taxes = Operating Income - Interest expense\n- Net Profit Before Taxes = $21,000,000 - $3,000,000\n- Net Profit Before Taxes = $18,000,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is 18000000."

The Company recorded a benefit of approximately $3.3 million resulting from the effect of a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. At March 31, 2018, we had $198.7 million of a federal net operating loss carryforward that expires, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038. For fiscal 2017, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the range of zero to $0.1 million of tax and zero to $0.2 million of interest based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated prior to Tax Act reform depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences.",

    "context": "\n<image 1>\n Note 9 – Debt Obligations Debt obligations as of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 consisted of the following: Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility On June 22, 2016, the Company refinanced its debt structure by entering into a credit agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for which Jefferies Finance LLC acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate amount of $305,000 (the loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, the “Term Loans”) maturing on June 22, 2022. Additionally, the Term Loan Facility includes an accordion which permits the Company to request that the lenders extend additional Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50,000 (less the aggregate amount of certain indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions) plus an unlimited amount subject to the Company’s Total Leverage Ratio not exceeding 4.90:1.00 on a pro forma basis. Borrowings were used to repay the Company’s senior secured notes, as well as the prior term loan and revolving credit facility. Remaining funds were used for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. On December 13, 2017, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce Applicable Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) from 475 basis points to 400 basis points over the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $761 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. On July 6, 2018, the Company made a $47,100 prepayment and is no longer required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loans. On November 16, 2018, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce the Applicable Rate from 400 basis points to 350 basis points over LIBOR. In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $626 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. The Company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees of $1,081 as a result of this repricing. The interest charged on the Term Loans, will be equal to a spread plus, at the Company’s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) or LIBOR for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month interest periods chosen by the Company. The interest rate on the Term Loans at December 27, 2019 was 5.2%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants (including restrictions, subject to customary exceptions, on incurring debt or liens, paying dividends, repaying payment subordinated and junior lien debt, disposing assets, and making investments and acquisitions), and events of default for a term loan B facility of this type, as more particularly described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Asset-Based Loan Facility On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for which BMO Harris Bank, N.A. acts as administrative agent. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for an asset-based loan facility (the “ABL”) in the aggregate amount of up to $150,000. Borrowings under the ABL will be used, and are expected to be used, for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. Availability under the ABL will be limited to a borrowing base equal to the lesser of: (i) the aggregate amount of commitments or (ii) the sum of specified percentages of eligible receivables and eligible inventory, minus certain availability reserves. The co-borrowers under the ABL are entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the ABL in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25,000. The ABL matures on the earlier of June 29, 2023 and 90 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s Term Loan Facility. The interest rate charged on borrowing under the ABL is equal to a spread plus, at the Company’s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) or LIBOR (except for swingline loans) for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month, interest periods chosen by the Company. The Company will pay certain recurring fees with respect to the ABL, including fees on unused lender commitments. The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default as more particularly described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The Company is required to comply with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 if the amount of availability under the ABL falls below $10,000 or 10% of the borrowing base. The Company incurred transaction costs of $877 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the ABL. On July 6, 2018, the Company borrowed $47,100 under the ABL and made an equivalent prepayment on its Term Loans. On November 22, 2019, the Company fully paid all borrowings outstanding under the ABL and there was no balance outstanding as of December 27, 2019. The weighted average interest rate on our ABL borrowings was approximately 3.7% during fiscal 2019. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants and the Company had reserved $16,641 of the ABL for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 27, 2019, funds totaling $133,359 were available for borrowing under the ABL. Convertible Senior Notes On November 22, 2019, the Company issued $150,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 22, 2019 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Approximately $43,225 of the net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the ABL and the Company intends to use the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions. The Senior Notes bear interest of 1.875% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2020. At any time before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of holders into shares of the Company’s common stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at an initial conversion price of approximately $44.20 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. The Senior Notes will mature on December 1, 2024, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Company may not redeem the Senior Notes at its option prior to maturity. In addition, if the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the required repurchase date. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $5,082 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. Convertible Unsecured Note On February 25, 2019, the Company issued a $4,000 convertible unsecured note (the “Unsecured Note”), maturing on June 29, 2023, to Bassian Farms, Inc. (the “Holder”) as partial consideration in the Bassian acquisition. The interest rate charged on the Unsecured Note is 4.5% per annum and increases to 5.0% after the two-year anniversary of the closing date. The Company may, in certain instances beginning eighteen months after issuance of the Unsecured Note, redeem the Unsecured Note in whole or in part for cash or convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price of $43.93 per share. After the two-year anniversary of the closing date, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price. Upon a change of control event, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price or redeem the Unsecured Note for cash.",

      "To determine the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase when someone deposits $700 at TD Bank, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Reserves and Deposits:**\n   - Initial Reserves = $493\n   - Initial Deposits = $2900\n\n2. **Calculate the Reserve Ratio:**\n   The reserve ratio is the proportion of deposits that the bank must hold as reserves. It can be calculated using the initial values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Reserve Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Reserves}}{\\text{Initial Deposits}} = \\frac{493}{2900} \\approx 0.1699 \\text{ or } 16.99\\%\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the New Deposits:**\n   When someone deposits $700, the new total deposits become:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Deposits} = \\text{Initial Deposits} + 700 = 2900 + 700 = 3600\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Required Reserves for New Deposits:**\n   Using the reserve ratio, the required reserves for the new deposits are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Required Reserves} = \\text{Reserve Ratio} \\times \\text{New Deposits} = 0.1699 \\times 3600 \\approx 611.64\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Excess Reserves:**\n   The excess reserves are the difference between the actual reserves and the required reserves. Initially, the bank had $493 in reserves. After the deposit, the bank's reserves increase by $700:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Reserves} = \\text{Initial Reserves} + 700 = 493 + 700 = 1193\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the excess reserves are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Excess Reserves} = \\text{New Reserves} - \\text{Required Reserves} = 1193 - 611.64 \\approx 581.36\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Money Multiplier:**\n   The money multiplier is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Reserve Ratio}} = \\frac{1}{0.1699} \\approx 5.89\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the Increase in Money Supply:**\n   The increase in the money supply is the product of the excess reserves and the money multiplier:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase in Money Supply} = \\text{Excess Reserves} \\times \\text{Money Multiplier} = 581.36 \\times 5.89 \\approx 3422.03\n   \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3422}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3422."

    "context": "\n<image 1>\n Other non-operating results The following details our other consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Interest expense: Interest expense increased by $1.2 million to $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $101.9 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to:\n• $28.9 million lower capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in the Hilli FLNG conversion following acceptance of the vessel by the charterer in May 2018; and\n• $1.5 million interest on the term loan facility, drawn in September 2019. This was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to lower LIBOR rates, resulting in:\n• $12.4 million decrease in interest expense arising on the loan facilities of our consolidated lessor VIEs;\n• $8.7 million capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investments;\n• $6.5 million decrease in interest expense incurred on the deposits received from Golar Partners following application of the deposit to the Hilli acquisition price and the conversion of the Hilli shareholder loans to equity following the Hilli Disposal in July 2018; and\n• $1.0 million decrease in interest expense on the Hilli letter of credit, due to a contractual step down in the Hilli letter of credit from $300 million to $250 million in May 2019, and a further step down to $125 million in November 2019. Losses on derivative instruments: Losses on derivative instruments increased by $7.5 million to a loss of $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.5 million for the same period in 2018. The movement was primarily due to: Net unrealized and realized (losses)/gains on interest rate swap agreements: As of December 31, 2019, we have an interest rate swap portfolio with a notional amount of $737.5 million, none of which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Net unrealized losses on the interest rate swaps increased to a loss of $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a gain of $0.6 million for the same period in 2018, due to a decline in the long-term swap rates, partially offset by the decreased notional value of our swap portfolio over the period. Realized gains on our interest rate swaps decreased to a gain of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a gain of $8.1 million for the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower LIBOR rates for the year ended December 31, 2019. Unrealized losses on Total Return Swap: In December 2014, we established a three month facility for a Stock Indexed Total Return Swap Programme or Equity Swap Line with DNB Bank ASA in connection with a share buyback scheme. In November 2019, we repurchased 1.5 million shares underlying the equity swap. The remaining facility has been extended to March 2020. The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.5 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.7 million for the same period in 2018. The losses in 2019 and 2018 are due to the decline in our share price. Unrealized mark-to-market losses on Earn-Out Units: This relates to the mark-to-market movement on the Earn-Out Units issuable in connection with the IDR reset transaction in October 2016, which we recognize as a derivative asset in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in Golar Partners' quarterly distribution to $0.4042 per common unit on October 24, 2018 resulted in the contingent Earn-Out Units arising out of the IDR reset transaction in October 2016 not crystallizing and, accordingly, we recognized a mark-to-market loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, effectively reducing the derivative asset to $nil at December 31, 2018. There was no comparative movement for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other financial items, net: Other financial items, net decreased by $4.0 million to a loss of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of consolidating our lessor VIEs. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased by $26.4 million to $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $63.2 million for the same period in 2018 mainly due to the completion of the Hilli Disposal in July 2018. The non-controlling interest in relation to the Hilli Disposal for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $61.7 million, compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2018. The net income attributable to non-controlling interests comprises of: • $36.5 million and $19.7 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Hilli LLC for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively; • $0.5 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Gimi MS Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019, following the subscription of 30% equity interest by First FLNG Holdings in April 2019; and • $28.3 million and $31.9 million in relation to the equity interests in our remaining lessor VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.",

The acquisitions presented below are not material, but the Company gives the information to provide the reader a summarized view of the content of the acquisitions made. The acquisitions consist primarily of: Kathrein: On October 2, 2019, the Company acquired assets from Kathrein, a world leading provider of antenna and filter technologies with approximately 4,000 employees. Kathrein’s antenna and filters business has a strong R&D organization with extensive experience in antenna design and research, coupled with a strong IPR portfolio. In addition to broadening Ericsson’s portfolio of antenna and filter products, the acquisition will bring vital competence for the evolution of advanced radio network products. The acquired Kathrein business has had a negative impact of SEK –0.5 billion since the acquisition, corresponding to –1 percentage point in Networks operating margin. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are preliminary. CSF: On August 20, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in CSF Holdings Inc. a US-based technology company with approximately 25 employees. CSF strengthens iconectiv’s Business to Consumer (B2C) product platforms to enable growth in messaging and Toll-Free Number (TFN) management. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are final. ST-Ericsson: Before ST-Ericsson was a joint venture where Ericsson and ST Microelectronics had a 50/50 ownership. This joint venture consisted of a number of legal entities where the two parties owned different stakes in the different legal entities. In December 2019 the Company initiated transactions to wind-down the legal structure of ST-Ericsson by acquiring the remaining shares in two legal ST-Ericsson entities and costs of SEK –0.3 billion impacted the result. The Company now owns 100% of the shares in those entities. In order to finalize a Purchase price allocation all relevant information needs to be in place. Examples of such information are final consideration and final opening balances, they may remain preliminary for a period of time due\nto for example adjustments of working capital, tax items or decisions from local authorities. 1) Acquisition-related costs are included in Selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.",

INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS) Basic EPS is calculated under the two-class method under which all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Our outstanding convertible preferred stocks are considered participating securities as the holders may participate in undistributed earnings with holders of common shares and are not obligated to share in our net losses. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income attributable to RiceBran Technologies common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the impact of assumed exercises and conversions is dilutive. The dilutive effects of outstanding options, warrants, nonvested shares and restricted stock units that vest solely on the basis of a service condition are calculated using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of the outstanding preferred stock are calculated using the if-converted method. Below are reconciliations of the numerators and denominators in the EPS computations, and information on potentially dilutive securities. The impacts of potentially dilutive securities outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS in 2019 and 2018 because to do so would be anti-dilutive. Those securities listed in the table above which were anti-dilutive in 2019 and 2018, which remain outstanding, could potentially dilute EPS in the future.",

      "To answer this question, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The scenario involves a plane cabin depressurization where oxygen masks have fallen. You are traveling with a small child.\n\n2. **Egoism vs. Altruism**:\n   - **Egoism** is focused on self-preservation.\n   - **Altruism** is focused on helping others, even at the cost of one's own well-being.\n\n3. **Reconciliation of Egoism and Altruism**: In an emergency situation like a depressurized cabin, the best course of action is to put on your own oxygen mask first before assisting others (including children). This ensures you can remain conscious and capable of helping the child effectively. This approach reconciles egoism (self-preservation) with altruism (helping the child).\n\n4. **Analyzing the Images**:\n   - **Top Left Image**: Shows a person putting on their own mask while ignoring the child. This represents pure egoism.\n   - **Top Right Image**: Shows a person putting the child's mask on first. This represents pure altruism.\n   - **Bottom Right Image**: Shows a person putting on their own mask first and then assisting the child. This represents the reconciliation of egoism and altruism.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The bottom right image shows the correct sequence of actions that reconcile egoism and altruism in this emergency situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3."

on a first-in first-out basis . property , plant and equipment 2013 property , plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation . depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and improvements , three to eight years for machinery and equipment and generally five years for instruments . maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred . in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards ( 201csfas 201d ) no . 144 , 201caccounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets , 201d we review property , plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable . an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset are less than its carrying amount . an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value . software costs 2013 we capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended . capitalized software costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software and compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project . capitalized software costs are included in property , plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software , which approximate three to seven years . instruments 2013 instruments are hand held devices used by orthopaedic surgeons during total joint replacement and other surgical procedures . instruments are recognized as long-lived assets and are included in property , plant and equipment . undeployed instruments are carried at cost , net of allowances for excess and obsolete instruments . instruments in the field are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation . depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on average estimated useful lives , determined principally in reference to associated product life cycles , primarily five years . we review instruments for impairment in accordance with sfas no . 144 . depreciation of instruments is recognized as selling , general and administrative expense . goodwill 2013 we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no . 142 , 201cgoodwill and other intangible assets 201d . goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests . goodwill has been assigned to reporting units , which are consistent with our operating segments . we perform annual impairment tests by comparing each reporting unit 2019s fair value to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment . we perform this test in the fourth quarter of the year . if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill . the fair value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value of goodwill are determined based upon market multiples . intangible assets 2013 we account for intangible assets in accordance with sfas no . 142 . intangible assets are initially measured at their fair value . we have determined the fair value of our intangible assets either by the fair value of the consideration exchanged for the intangible asset , or the estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the intangible asset . intangible assets with an indefinite life , including certain trademarks and trade names , are not amortized . the useful lives of indefinite life intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life . intangible assets with a

      "To calculate the change in market share of the截止阀 (check valve) from 2022 to 2023 as a percentage of the 2022 market share, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the market share of the 截止阀 in 2022 and 2023.\n   - From the bar chart, the market share of the 截止阀 in 2022 is 32%.\n   - The market share of the 截止阀 in 2023 is 37%.\n\n2. Calculate the difference in market share between 2023 and 2022.\n   - Difference = Market share in 2023 - Market share in 2022\n   - Difference = 37% - 32% = 5%\n\n3. Express this difference as a percentage of the 2022 market share.\n   - Percentage change = (Difference / Market share in 2022) * 100%\n   - Percentage change = (5% / 32%) * 100% = 15.625%\n\n4. Round the result to one decimal place.\n   - Rounded percentage change = 15.6%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 15.6."

The Company has not updated its Section 382 analysis subsequent to 2009 and does not believe there have been any events subsequent to 2009 that would impact the analysis. The Company is required to recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company applies the interpretation to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open. The Company had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits and did not recognize any interest or penalties during the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, or 2017. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years ending prior to 2004. We are generally subject to U.S. federal and state tax examinations for all tax years since 2003 due to our net operating loss carryforwards and the utilization of the carryforwards in years still open under statute. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company was examined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal year 2016. This examination resulted in no adjustments. The Company changed its fiscal year end in 2007 from March 31 to September 30.",

    "context": "notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 1 . basis of presentation and accounting policies ( continued ) sop 03-1 was effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2003 . at the date of initial application , january 1 , 2004 , the cumulative effect of the adoption of sop 03-1 on net income and other comprehensive income was comprised of the following individual impacts shown net of income tax benefit of $ 12 : in may 2003 , the financial accounting standards board ( 201cfasb 201d ) issued statement of financial accounting standards ( 201csfas 201d ) no . 150 , 201caccounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 201d . sfas no . 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity . generally , sfas no . 150 requires liability classification for two broad classes of financial instruments : ( a ) instruments that represent , or are indexed to , an obligation to buy back the issuer 2019s shares regardless of whether the instrument is settled on a net-cash or gross-physical basis and ( b ) obligations that ( i ) can be settled in shares but derive their value predominately from another underlying instrument or index ( e.g . security prices , interest rates , and currency rates ) , ( ii ) have a fixed value , or ( iii ) have a value inversely related to the issuer 2019s shares . mandatorily redeemable equity and written options requiring the issuer to buyback shares are examples of financial instruments that should be reported as liabilities under this new guidance . sfas no . 150 specifies accounting only for certain freestanding financial instruments and does not affect whether an embedded derivative must be bifurcated and accounted for separately . sfas no . 150 was effective for instruments entered into or modified after may 31 , 2003 and for all other instruments beginning with the first interim reporting period beginning after june 15 , 2003 . adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company 2019s consolidated financial condition or results of operations . in january 2003 , the fasb issued interpretation no . 46 , 201cconsolidation of variable interest entities , an interpretation of arb no . 51 201d ( 201cfin 46 201d ) , which required an enterprise to assess whether consolidation of an entity is appropriate based upon its interests in a variable interest entity . a vie is an entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties . the initial determination of whether an entity is a vie shall be made on the date at which an enterprise becomes involved with the entity . an enterprise shall consolidate a vie if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the vies expected losses if they occur , receive a majority of the entity 2019s expected residual returns if they occur or both . fin 46 was effective immediately for new vies established or purchased subsequent to january 31 , 2003 . for vies established or purchased subsequent to january 31 , 2003 , the adoption of fin 46 did not have a material impact on the company 2019s consolidated financial condition or results of operations as there were no material vies which required consolidation . in december 2003 , the fasb issued a revised version of fin 46 ( 201cfin 46r 201d ) , which incorporated a number of modifications and changes made to the original version . fin 46r replaced the previously issued fin 46 and , subject to certain special provisions , was effective no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after december 15 , 2003 for entities considered to be special- purpose entities and no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march 15 , 2004 for all other vies . early adoption was permitted . the company adopted fin 46r in the fourth quarter of 2003 . the adoption of fin 46r did not result in the consolidation of any material vies but resulted in the deconsolidation of vies that issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts ( 201ctrust preferred securities 201d ) . the company is not the primary beneficiary of the vies , which issued the trust preferred securities . the company does not own any of the trust preferred securities which were issued to unrelated third parties . these trust preferred securities are considered the principal variable interests issued by the vies . as a result , the vies , which the company previously consolidated , are no longer consolidated . the sole assets of the vies are junior subordinated debentures issued by the company with payment terms identical to the trust preferred securities . previously , the trust preferred securities were reported as a separate liability on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheets as 201ccompany obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely junior subordinated debentures 201d . at december 31 , 2003 and 2002 , the impact of deconsolidation was to increase long-term debt and decrease the trust preferred securities by $ 952 and $ 1.5 billion , respectively . ( for further discussion , see note 14 for disclosure of information related to these vies as required under fin 46r. ) future adoption of new accounting standards in december 2004 , the fasb issued sfas no . 123 ( revised 2004 ) , 201cshare-based payment 201d ( 201csfas no . 123r 201d ) , which replaces sfas no . 123 , 201caccounting for stock-based compensation 201d ( 201csfas no . 123 201d ) and supercedes apb opinion no . 25 , 201caccounting for stock issued to employees 201d . sfas no . 123r requires all companies to recognize compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of the award for financial statements for reporting periods beginning after june 15 , 2005 . the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no . 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition . the transition methods include prospective and retrospective adoption options . the prospective method requires that .\n\n<image 1>\n\n.\n",

ACQUISITIONS MGI On April 4, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets comprising the business of MGI Grain Processing, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, now conducting business as MGI Grain Incorporated (MGI) for an aggregate purchase price of $3.8 million. The purchase price included $0.3 million deposited in an escrow account at closing which was subsequently released to the sellers in June 2019. MGI owns and operates a grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. We acquired MGI as part of our strategy to expand our product portfolio. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of MGI’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning April 4, 2019. In 2019, we incurred $0.1 million of MGI acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The purchase price for MGI was subject to adjustment if the estimated closing working capital with respect to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed was different than the actual closing working capital, as defined in the purchase agreement. The seller of MGI paid a working capital adjustment of $18 thousand in 2019. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation, the consideration transferred to acquire MGI and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands). In the fourth quarter of 2019, our appraiser finalized certain fair value calculations and we completed our review of the calculations. The fair value of MGI’s trade receivables at acquisition, equaled the gross amount of trade receivables. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible at acquisition was estimated using an income approach based on expected future cash flows. As discussed in Note 9, we are amortizing the customer relationship intangible to expense over the 15-year period of expected future economic benefit, in proportion to the discounted expected future cash flows used to estimate the value of the intangible at acquisition. Goodwill primarily was attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and synergies generated by MGI when combined with our existing operations. The $0.7 million allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over the next fifteen years.",

A total of 500,000 shares were initially reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Plan was amended several times since then to eventually increase the authorized shares to 2,500,000 as of December 31, 2019. A total of 1,624,221 shares of common stock underlying options were outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Company had 236,614 remaining shares available to grant under the Plan at December 31, 2019. The Plan allows the Company to grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, or restricted stock. The incentive stock options are exercisable for up to ten years, at an option price per share not less than the fair market value on the date the option is granted. The incentive stock options are limited to persons who are regular full-time employees of the Company at the date of the grant of the option. Non-qualified options may be granted to any person, including, but not limited to, employees, independent agents, consultants and attorneys, who the Company’s Board or Compensation Committee believes have contributed, or will contribute, to the success of the Company. Non-qualified options may be issued at option prices of less than fair market value on the date of grant and may be exercisable for up to ten years from date of grant. The option vesting schedule for options granted is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of the grant. The Plan provides for accelerated vesting of unvested options if there is a change in control, as defined in the Plan. The compensation cost that has been charged against income related to options for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $1,687,745 and $1,317,904, respectively. No income tax benefit was recognized in the income statement and no compensation was capitalized in any of the years presented. The Company had the following option activity during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Of the options outstanding at December 31, 2019, 1,143,637 were exercisable with a weighted average contractual life of 1.9 years.",

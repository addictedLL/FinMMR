If additional years were needed or if there was an error in the question, please clarify. However, based on the information available, the calculated growth rate is 10.75%."

Let's assume it's \"液化石油气\" (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) since it has data points for both years.\n\n2.

Calculate the difference between the two years' values:\n   Difference = 921 kBD - 408 kBD = 513 kBD\n\n4. Divide the difference by the 2023 value to find the ratio of increase:\n   Ratio = 513 kBD / 408 kBD ≈ 1.2576\n\n5.

The Company recorded a benefit of approximately $3.3 million resulting from the effect of a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. At March 31, 2018, we had $198.7 million of a federal net operating loss carryforward that expires, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038. For fiscal 2017, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the range of zero to $0.1 million of tax and zero to $0.2 million of interest based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated prior to Tax Act reform depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences.",

            "Step 1: Understand the Expectations Theory\nThe Expectations Theory states that the yield curve reflects investors' expectations about future short-term interest rates. If investors expect interest rates to rise in the future, they will demand higher yields today to compensate for the risk of lower returns if interest rates do indeed rise.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the Current Term Structure\nFrom Image 1, we have:\n- 1-year bond: 5%\n- 2-year bond: 6%\n- 3-year bond: 7%\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Expected Term Structure\nFrom Image 2, we have:\n- 1-year bond (expected next year): 4%\n- 2-year bond (expected next year): 5%\n- 3-year bond (expected next year): 6%\n\nStep 4: Apply the Expectations Theory\nAccording to the Expectations Theory, the expected yield on a 1-year bond one year from now would be equal to the current yield on a 2-year bond because the 1-year bond will mature into a 2-year bond after one year.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the Expected Yield for 1-Year Bonds\nSince the 1-year bond matures into a 2-year bond after one year, its yield must match the expected yield on a 2-year bond one year from now. Therefore, the expected yield on a 1-year bond one year from now is 5%.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the Expected Yield for 2-Year Bonds\nSimilarly, since the 2-year bond matures into a 3-year bond after one year, its yield must match the expected yield on a 3-year bond one year from now. Therefore, the expected yield on a 2-year bond one year from now is 6%.\n\nFinal Answer: The market expects to observe yields to maturity of 5% on 1-year zeros and 6% on 2-year zeros at the end of the year."

        "context": "\n<image 1>\n Note 9 – Debt Obligations Debt obligations as of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 consisted of the following: Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility On June 22, 2016, the Company refinanced its debt structure by entering into a credit agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for which Jefferies Finance LLC acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate amount of $305,000 (the loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, the “Term Loans”) maturing on June 22, 2022. Additionally, the Term Loan Facility includes an accordion which permits the Company to request that the lenders extend additional Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50,000 (less the aggregate amount of certain indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions) plus an unlimited amount subject to the Company’s Total Leverage Ratio not exceeding 4.90:1.00 on a pro forma basis. Borrowings were used to repay the Company’s senior secured notes, as well as the prior term loan and revolving credit facility. Remaining funds were used for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. On December 13, 2017, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce Applicable Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) from 475 basis points to 400 basis points over the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $761 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. On July 6, 2018, the Company made a $47,100 prepayment and is no longer required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loans. On November 16, 2018, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce the Applicable Rate from 400 basis points to 350 basis points over LIBOR. In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $626 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. The Company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees of $1,081 as a result of this repricing. The interest charged on the Term Loans, will be equal to a spread plus, at the Company’s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) or LIBOR for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month interest periods chosen by the Company. The interest rate on the Term Loans at December 27, 2019 was 5.2%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants (including restrictions, subject to customary exceptions, on incurring debt or liens, paying dividends, repaying payment subordinated and junior lien debt, disposing assets, and making investments and acquisitions), and events of default for a term loan B facility of this type, as more particularly described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Asset-Based Loan Facility On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for which BMO Harris Bank, N.A. acts as administrative agent. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for an asset-based loan facility (the “ABL”) in the aggregate amount of up to $150,000. Borrowings under the ABL will be used, and are expected to be used, for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. Availability under the ABL will be limited to a borrowing base equal to the lesser of: (i) the aggregate amount of commitments or (ii) the sum of specified percentages of eligible receivables and eligible inventory, minus certain availability reserves. The co-borrowers under the ABL are entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the ABL in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25,000. The ABL matures on the earlier of June 29, 2023 and 90 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s Term Loan Facility. The interest rate charged on borrowing under the ABL is equal to a spread plus, at the Company’s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) or LIBOR (except for swingline loans) for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month, interest periods chosen by the Company. The Company will pay certain recurring fees with respect to the ABL, including fees on unused lender commitments. The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default as more particularly described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The Company is required to comply with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 if the amount of availability under the ABL falls below $10,000 or 10% of the borrowing base. The Company incurred transaction costs of $877 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the ABL. On July 6, 2018, the Company borrowed $47,100 under the ABL and made an equivalent prepayment on its Term Loans. On November 22, 2019, the Company fully paid all borrowings outstanding under the ABL and there was no balance outstanding as of December 27, 2019. The weighted average interest rate on our ABL borrowings was approximately 3.7% during fiscal 2019. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants and the Company had reserved $16,641 of the ABL for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 27, 2019, funds totaling $133,359 were available for borrowing under the ABL. Convertible Senior Notes On November 22, 2019, the Company issued $150,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 22, 2019 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Approximately $43,225 of the net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the ABL and the Company intends to use the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions. The Senior Notes bear interest of 1.875% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2020. At any time before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of holders into shares of the Company’s common stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at an initial conversion price of approximately $44.20 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. The Senior Notes will mature on December 1, 2024, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Company may not redeem the Senior Notes at its option prior to maturity. In addition, if the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the required repurchase date. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $5,082 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. Convertible Unsecured Note On February 25, 2019, the Company issued a $4,000 convertible unsecured note (the “Unsecured Note”), maturing on June 29, 2023, to Bassian Farms, Inc. (the “Holder”) as partial consideration in the Bassian acquisition. The interest rate charged on the Unsecured Note is 4.5% per annum and increases to 5.0% after the two-year anniversary of the closing date. The Company may, in certain instances beginning eighteen months after issuance of the Unsecured Note, redeem the Unsecured Note in whole or in part for cash or convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price of $43.93 per share. After the two-year anniversary of the closing date, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price. Upon a change of control event, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price or redeem the Unsecured Note for cash.",

Locate the specific figure:\n   - In the provided text, there's a section discussing \"net interest income.\"\n   - It states that \"net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $3.77 billion for 2018.\"\n\n3. Verify if this matches the 2016 figure:\n   - The text then mentions \"2017 versus 2016 net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $32.73 billion for 2017, 6% (6%) higher than 2016,\" indicating that the 2016 figure is available but not explicitly stated.\n\n4. Find the direct statement for 2016:\n   - The text provides a detailed breakdown of revenue changes between 2017 and 2016, including net interest income.\n   - It states that \"net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $2.93 billion for 2017, 13% (13%) higher than 2016.\"\n\n5.

volumes in the u.s . also declined . market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 7.66 billion for 2017 , 23% ( 23 % ) lower than 2016 , due to significantly lower revenues in commodities , currencies , credit products , interest rate products and equity derivative products . these results were partially offset by significantly higher revenues in equity cash products and significantly improved results in mortgages . other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 5.91 billion for 2017 , 75% ( 75 % ) higher than 2016 , primarily reflecting a significant increase in net gains from private equities , which were positively impacted by company-specific events and corporate performance . in addition , net gains from public equities were significantly higher , as global equity prices increased during the year . net interest income . net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $ 2.93 billion for 2017 , 13% ( 13 % ) higher than 2016 , reflecting an increase in interest income primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on collateralized agreements , higher interest income from loans receivable due to higher yields and an increase in total average loans receivable , an increase in total average financial instruments owned , and the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks . the increase in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-bearing liabilities , an increase in total average long-term borrowings , and the impact of higher interest rates on interest-bearing deposits , short-term borrowings and collateralized financings . see 201cstatistical disclosures 2014 distribution of assets , liabilities and shareholders 2019 equity 201d for further information about our sources of net interest income . provision

We need to focus on the bars corresponding to scores between 80.5 and 82.\n\n2. **Determine the width of the score range**: The score range we're interested in is from 80.5 to 82. This means we need to look at the portion of the bars that fall within this range.\n\n3. **Calculate the proportion of the total area**: Since the bars represent different occupations and their emotional health index scores, we assume they are uniformly distributed across the entire range of possible scores (from approximately 76 to 84). Therefore, the proportion of the total area covered by the bars between 80.5 and 82 will give us the probability.\n\n4. **Estimate the proportion visually**: By examining the chart, we can estimate how much of the total area falls between 80.5 and 82. This involves comparing the height of the bars in this range to the overall height of the bars.\n\n5. **Convert the proportion to a percentage**: Once we have the proportion, we multiply it by 100 to convert it into a percentage.\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find that the proportion of the total area covered by the bars between 80.5 and 82 is approximately 0.12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12.00%."

The correct approach would involve calculating the annual growth rate over the period from 2014 to 2015, which is not directly possible without additional information about intermediate years' data. Given the data available, the direct calculation yields an unrealistic figure due to the large jump in company numbers within one year. Therefore, the question might require more detailed historical data spanning several years to provide a meaningful growth rate calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {956.00%}."

            "To determine the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase when someone deposits $700 at TD Bank, we can use the concept of the money multiplier. Here’s how it works:\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Identify the Money Multiplier**:\n   - The money multiplier (m) is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{1}{\\text{Reserves Ratio}}\n     \\]\n   - From the balance sheet, the reserves ratio is the ratio of reserves to total deposits:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Reserves Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Reserves}}{\\text{Total Deposits}} = \\frac{493}{2900}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Reserves Ratio**:\n   - First, calculate the fraction:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{493}{2900} \\approx 0.1703\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Money Multiplier**:\n   - Now, find the reciprocal of the reserves ratio to get the money multiplier:\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{1}{0.1703} \\approx 5.876\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Increase in Money Supply**:\n   - The increase in the money supply (\\(\\Delta M\\)) due to an initial deposit (\\(D\\)) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta M = D \\times m\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\(D = 700\\) and \\(m \\approx 5.876\\):\n     \\[\n     \\Delta M = 700 \\times 5.876 \\approx 4113.2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round to Nearest Integer**:\n   - Finally, round the result to the nearest integer:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta M \\approx 4113\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimum amount by which the money supply will increase when someone deposits $700 at TD Bank is approximately **$4113**."

The increase in interest expense was primarily due to:\n• $28.9 million lower capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in the Hilli FLNG conversion following acceptance of the vessel by the charterer in May 2018; and\n• $1.5 million interest on the term loan facility, drawn in September 2019. This was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to lower LIBOR rates, resulting in:\n• $12.4 million decrease in interest expense arising on the loan facilities of our consolidated lessor VIEs;\n• $8.7 million capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investments;\n• $6.5 million decrease in interest expense incurred on the deposits received from Golar Partners following application of the deposit to the Hilli acquisition price and the conversion of the Hilli shareholder loans to equity following the Hilli Disposal in July 2018; and\n• $1.0 million decrease in interest expense on the Hilli letter of credit, due to a contractual step down in the Hilli letter of credit from $300 million to $250 million in May 2019, and a further step down to $125 million in November 2019. Losses on derivative instruments: Losses on derivative instruments increased by $7.5 million to a loss of $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.5 million for the same period in 2018. The movement was primarily due to: Net unrealized and realized (losses)/gains on interest rate swap agreements: As of December 31, 2019, we have an interest rate swap portfolio with a notional amount of $737.5 million, none of which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Net unrealized losses on the interest rate swaps increased to a loss of $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a gain of $0.6 million for the same period in 2018, due to a decline in the long-term swap rates, partially offset by the decreased notional value of our swap portfolio over the period. Realized gains on our interest rate swaps decreased to a gain of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a gain of $8.1 million for the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower LIBOR rates for the year ended December 31, 2019. Unrealized losses on Total Return Swap: In December 2014, we established a three month facility for a Stock Indexed Total Return Swap Programme or Equity Swap Line with DNB Bank ASA in connection with a share buyback scheme. In November 2019, we repurchased 1.5 million shares underlying the equity swap. The remaining facility has been extended to March 2020. The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.5 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.7 million for the same period in 2018. The losses in 2019 and 2018 are due to the decline in our share price. Unrealized mark-to-market losses on Earn-Out Units: This relates to the mark-to-market movement on the Earn-Out Units issuable in connection with the IDR reset transaction in October 2016, which we recognize as a derivative asset in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in Golar Partners' quarterly distribution to $0.4042 per common unit on October 24, 2018 resulted in the contingent Earn-Out Units arising out of the IDR reset transaction in October 2016 not crystallizing and, accordingly, we recognized a mark-to-market loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, effectively reducing the derivative asset to $nil at December 31, 2018. There was no comparative movement for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other financial items, net: Other financial items, net decreased by $4.0 million to a loss of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of consolidating our lessor VIEs. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased by $26.4 million to $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $63.2 million for the same period in 2018 mainly due to the completion of the Hilli Disposal in July 2018. The non-controlling interest in relation to the Hilli Disposal for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $61.7 million, compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2018. The net income attributable to non-controlling interests comprises of: • $36.5 million and $19.7 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Hilli LLC for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively; • $0.5 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Gimi MS Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019, following the subscription of 30% equity interest by First FLNG Holdings in April 2019; and • $28.3 million and $31.9 million in relation to the equity interests in our remaining lessor VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.",

Let's correct our approach:\n\nCorrect Approach:\n- The decrease of 10 million is applied to the 2019 figure only.\n- Therefore, the change in total consideration between 2019 and 2018 considering the decrease is simply the decrease itself because no other figures are affected by this change.\n\nFinal Calculation:\n- Change = Decrease in 2019 total consideration = 10 million\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10."

The acquisitions presented below are not material, but the Company gives the information to provide the reader a summarized view of the content of the acquisitions made. The acquisitions consist primarily of: Kathrein: On October 2, 2019, the Company acquired assets from Kathrein, a world leading provider of antenna and filter technologies with approximately 4,000 employees. Kathrein’s antenna and filters business has a strong R&D organization with extensive experience in antenna design and research, coupled with a strong IPR portfolio. In addition to broadening Ericsson’s portfolio of antenna and filter products, the acquisition will bring vital competence for the evolution of advanced radio network products. The acquired Kathrein business has had a negative impact of SEK –0.5 billion since the acquisition, corresponding to –1 percentage point in Networks operating margin. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are preliminary. CSF: On August 20, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in CSF Holdings Inc. a US-based technology company with approximately 25 employees. CSF strengthens iconectiv’s Business to Consumer (B2C) product platforms to enable growth in messaging and Toll-Free Number (TFN) management. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are final. ST-Ericsson: Before ST-Ericsson was a joint venture where Ericsson and ST Microelectronics had a 50/50 ownership. This joint venture consisted of a number of legal entities where the two parties owned different stakes in the different legal entities. In December 2019 the Company initiated transactions to wind-down the legal structure of ST-Ericsson by acquiring the remaining shares in two legal ST-Ericsson entities and costs of SEK –0.3 billion impacted the result. The Company now owns 100% of the shares in those entities. In order to finalize a Purchase price allocation all relevant information needs to be in place. Examples of such information are final consideration and final opening balances, they may remain preliminary for a period of time due\nto for example adjustments of working capital, tax items or decisions from local authorities. 1) Acquisition-related costs are included in Selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.",

            "To calculate the growth rate for the GFS segment in 2016, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the revenue for the GFS segment in 2015 and 2016:\n   - 2015: $2,360 million\n   - 2016: $4,250 million\n\n2. Calculate the change in revenue between 2015 and 2016:\n   Change = Revenue in 2016 - Revenue in 2015\n   Change = $4,250 million - $2,360 million\n   Change = $1,890 million\n\n3. Divide the change in revenue by the revenue in 2015 to get the growth rate:\n   Growth Rate = (Change / Revenue in 2015) * 100%\n   Growth Rate = ($1,890 million / $2,360 million) * 100%\n\n4. Simplify the calculation:\n   Growth Rate ≈ 0.7991 * 100%\n   Growth Rate ≈ 79.91%\n\nRounding to three decimal places gives us a growth rate of approximately 79.9%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 79.9%."

However, since the net income for 2015 is not explicitly stated and only the increase is mentioned, it implies that the net income for 2015 was zero or negligible, making the percentage increase infinite or undefined.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most accurate interpretation is that there was no net income in 2015, leading to an undefined percentage increase when trying to calculate it using standard formulas.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {undefined}."

INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS) Basic EPS is calculated under the two-class method under which all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Our outstanding convertible preferred stocks are considered participating securities as the holders may participate in undistributed earnings with holders of common shares and are not obligated to share in our net losses. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income attributable to RiceBran Technologies common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the impact of assumed exercises and conversions is dilutive. The dilutive effects of outstanding options, warrants, nonvested shares and restricted stock units that vest solely on the basis of a service condition are calculated using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of the outstanding preferred stock are calculated using the if-converted method. Below are reconciliations of the numerators and denominators in the EPS computations, and information on potentially dilutive securities. The impacts of potentially dilutive securities outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS in 2019 and 2018 because to do so would be anti-dilutive. Those securities listed in the table above which were anti-dilutive in 2019 and 2018, which remain outstanding, could potentially dilute EPS in the future.",

Calculate the difference between the two years:\n   Difference = 10.6 million - 9.7 million = 0.9 million users\n\n3. Divide the difference by the base year (2023) to find the growth rate:\n   Growth Rate = (Difference / Base Year) * 100%\n                = (0.9 million / 9.7 million) * 100%\n\n4.

This suggests they are prioritizing their own survival (egoism) before helping the child (altruism).\n\n2. **Middle Image**: This image is blank, indicating no action taken yet.\n\n3. **Right Image**: This image shows a person wearing an oxygen mask while another person, possibly a child, is being held and comforted.

            "The chi-square (χ²) test statistic measures how well the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies under a null hypothesis. Here’s how we calculate it:\n\n1. **Expected Frequencies**: These are calculated using the proportions from Table 11.21 and the total number of students (20). For example, for grade A:\n   - Expected frequency = Proportion * Total number of students\n   - Expected frequency for A = 0.25 * 20 = 5\n\n2. **Observed Frequencies**: These are directly taken from Table 11.22. For grade A:\n   - Observed frequency = 7\n\n3. **Calculate the χ² Test Statistic**:\n   - Formula: Χ² = Σ [(O - E)² / E]\n     Where O is the observed frequency and E is the expected frequency.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - For Grade A: (7 - 5)² / 5 = 4 / 5 = 0.8\n   - For Grade B: (7 - 6)² / 6 = 1 / 6 ≈ 0.1667\n   - For Grade C: (5 - 7)² / 7 = 4 / 7 ≈ 0.5714\n   - For Grade D: (1 - 2)² / 2 = 1 / 2 = 0.5\n\n5. **Summing Up**:\n   - Χ² = 0.8 + 0.1667 + 0.5714 + 0.5 = 2.0381\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives us 2.04.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.04."

Identify the goodwill from the Golden Ridge acquisition:\n   - 2018: $3,178\n\n2. Identify the goodwill from the MGI acquisition:\n   - 2019: $737\n\n3. Double the goodwill from the MGI acquisition:\n   - $737 * 2 = $1,474\n\n4. Decrease this doubled amount by $50,000:\n   - $1,474 - $50,000 = -$48,526\n\n5. Add the doubled and adjusted MGI acquisition goodwill to the Golden Ridge acquisition goodwill:\n   - $3,178 + (-$48,526) = -$45,348\n\n6. Since we're looking at totals for both years combined, add the goodwill from the Golden Ridge acquisition in 2018:\n   - -$45,348 + $3,178 = -$42,170\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the total goodwill \"obtained\" which implies a positive value, it seems there might have been an oversight or misinterpretation in the calculation process.\n\nGiven that the question asks for the total goodwill obtained from acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 after doubling the MGI acquisition goodwill and decreasing it by $50,000, let's re-evaluate the approach:\n\n- Double the MGI acquisition goodwill: $737 * 2 = $1,474\n- Subtract $50,000 from the doubled amount: $1,474 - $50,000 = -$48,526\n- Add the doubled and adjusted MGI acquisition goodwill to the Golden Ridge acquisition goodwill: $3,178 + (-$48,526) = -$45,348\n\nSince the result is negative, it indicates that the adjustment exceeded the original goodwill amounts, resulting in a net decrease rather than an increase in goodwill.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -$45,348. However, considering the context of obtaining total goodwill, it appears there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the question. The correct interpretation should focus on the positive aspect of obtaining goodwill, not the net effect of adjustments. Given the data provided, no additional goodwill was actually obtained beyond what was already present due to the nature of the adjustments applied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0."

The Company has not updated its Section 382 analysis subsequent to 2009 and does not believe there have been any events subsequent to 2009 that would impact the analysis. The Company is required to recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company applies the interpretation to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open. The Company had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits and did not recognize any interest or penalties during the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, or 2017. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years ending prior to 2004. We are generally subject to U.S. federal and state tax examinations for all tax years since 2003 due to our net operating loss carryforwards and the utilization of the carryforwards in years still open under statute. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company was examined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal year 2016. This examination resulted in no adjustments. The Company changed its fiscal year end in 2007 from March 31 to September 30.",

            "To calculate the difference between the 2023 and 2024 year-on-year (YOY) growth rates for the daily average stock turnover amount, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the YOY growth rate for 2023:\n   - From the table, the YOY growth rate for 2023 is -5.2%.\n\n2. Identify the YOY growth rate for 2024:\n   - From the table, the YOY growth rate for 2024 is 21.2%.\n\n3. Calculate the difference between the two growth rates:\n   - Difference = Growth Rate of 2024 - Growth Rate of 2023\n   - Difference = 21.2% - (-5.2%) \n   - Difference = 21.2% + 5.2%\n   - Difference = 26.4%\n\n4. Convert this difference into a percentage of the 2023 growth rate:\n   - Percentage = (Difference / Growth Rate of 2023) * 100\n   - Percentage = (26.4% / -5.2%) * 100\n   - Percentage ≈ -507.69%\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately -507.69%."

ACQUISITIONS MGI On April 4, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets comprising the business of MGI Grain Processing, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, now conducting business as MGI Grain Incorporated (MGI) for an aggregate purchase price of $3.8 million. The purchase price included $0.3 million deposited in an escrow account at closing which was subsequently released to the sellers in June 2019. MGI owns and operates a grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. We acquired MGI as part of our strategy to expand our product portfolio. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of MGI’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning April 4, 2019. In 2019, we incurred $0.1 million of MGI acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The purchase price for MGI was subject to adjustment if the estimated closing working capital with respect to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed was different than the actual closing working capital, as defined in the purchase agreement. The seller of MGI paid a working capital adjustment of $18 thousand in 2019. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation, the consideration transferred to acquire MGI and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands). In the fourth quarter of 2019, our appraiser finalized certain fair value calculations and we completed our review of the calculations. The fair value of MGI’s trade receivables at acquisition, equaled the gross amount of trade receivables. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible at acquisition was estimated using an income approach based on expected future cash flows. As discussed in Note 9, we are amortizing the customer relationship intangible to expense over the 15-year period of expected future economic benefit, in proportion to the discounted expected future cash flows used to estimate the value of the intangible at acquisition. Goodwill primarily was attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and synergies generated by MGI when combined with our existing operations. The $0.7 million allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over the next fifteen years.",

A total of 500,000 shares were initially reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Plan was amended several times since then to eventually increase the authorized shares to 2,500,000 as of December 31, 2019. A total of 1,624,221 shares of common stock underlying options were outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Company had 236,614 remaining shares available to grant under the Plan at December 31, 2019. The Plan allows the Company to grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, or restricted stock. The incentive stock options are exercisable for up to ten years, at an option price per share not less than the fair market value on the date the option is granted. The incentive stock options are limited to persons who are regular full-time employees of the Company at the date of the grant of the option. Non-qualified options may be granted to any person, including, but not limited to, employees, independent agents, consultants and attorneys, who the Company’s Board or Compensation Committee believes have contributed, or will contribute, to the success of the Company. Non-qualified options may be issued at option prices of less than fair market value on the date of grant and may be exercisable for up to ten years from date of grant. The option vesting schedule for options granted is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of the grant. The Plan provides for accelerated vesting of unvested options if there is a change in control, as defined in the Plan. The compensation cost that has been charged against income related to options for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $1,687,745 and $1,317,904, respectively. No income tax benefit was recognized in the income statement and no compensation was capitalized in any of the years presented. The Company had the following option activity during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Of the options outstanding at December 31, 2019, 1,143,637 were exercisable with a weighted average contractual life of 1.9 years.",

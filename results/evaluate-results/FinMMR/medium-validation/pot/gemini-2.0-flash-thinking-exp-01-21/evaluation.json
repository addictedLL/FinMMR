        "question": "What would be the change in the value of Finance lease and other financing obligations between 2018 and 2019 if the value in 2018 increases by $1,000?",
        "context": "\n<image 1>\n Note 9 – Debt Obligations Debt obligations as of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 consisted of the following: Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility On June 22, 2016, the Company refinanced its debt structure by entering into a credit agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for which Jefferies Finance LLC acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate amount of $305,000 (the loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, the “Term Loans”) maturing on June 22, 2022. Additionally, the Term Loan Facility includes an accordion which permits the Company to request that the lenders extend additional Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50,000 (less the aggregate amount of certain indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions) plus an unlimited amount subject to the Company’s Total Leverage Ratio not exceeding 4.90:1.00 on a pro forma basis. Borrowings were used to repay the Company’s senior secured notes, as well as the prior term loan and revolving credit facility. Remaining funds were used for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. On December 13, 2017, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce Applicable Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) from 475 basis points to 400 basis points over the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $761 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. On July 6, 2018, the Company made a $47,100 prepayment and is no longer required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loans. On November 16, 2018, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce the Applicable Rate from 400 basis points to 350 basis points over LIBOR. In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $626 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. The Company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees of $1,081 as a result of this repricing. The interest charged on the Term Loans, will be equal to a spread plus, at the Company’s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) or LIBOR for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month interest periods chosen by the Company. The interest rate on the Term Loans at December 27, 2019 was 5.2%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants (including restrictions, subject to customary exceptions, on incurring debt or liens, paying dividends, repaying payment subordinated and junior lien debt, disposing assets, and making investments and acquisitions), and events of default for a term loan B facility of this type, as more particularly described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Asset-Based Loan Facility On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for which BMO Harris Bank, N.A. acts as administrative agent. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for an asset-based loan facility (the “ABL”) in the aggregate amount of up to $150,000. Borrowings under the ABL will be used, and are expected to be used, for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. Availability under the ABL will be limited to a borrowing base equal to the lesser of: (i) the aggregate amount of commitments or (ii) the sum of specified percentages of eligible receivables and eligible inventory, minus certain availability reserves. The co-borrowers under the ABL are entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the ABL in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25,000. The ABL matures on the earlier of June 29, 2023 and 90 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s Term Loan Facility. The interest rate charged on borrowing under the ABL is equal to a spread plus, at the Company’s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) or LIBOR (except for swingline loans) for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month, interest periods chosen by the Company. The Company will pay certain recurring fees with respect to the ABL, including fees on unused lender commitments. The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default as more particularly described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The Company is required to comply with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 if the amount of availability under the ABL falls below $10,000 or 10% of the borrowing base. The Company incurred transaction costs of $877 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the ABL. On July 6, 2018, the Company borrowed $47,100 under the ABL and made an equivalent prepayment on its Term Loans. On November 22, 2019, the Company fully paid all borrowings outstanding under the ABL and there was no balance outstanding as of December 27, 2019. The weighted average interest rate on our ABL borrowings was approximately 3.7% during fiscal 2019. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants and the Company had reserved $16,641 of the ABL for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 27, 2019, funds totaling $133,359 were available for borrowing under the ABL. Convertible Senior Notes On November 22, 2019, the Company issued $150,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 22, 2019 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Approximately $43,225 of the net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the ABL and the Company intends to use the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions. The Senior Notes bear interest of 1.875% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2020. At any time before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of holders into shares of the Company’s common stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at an initial conversion price of approximately $44.20 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. The Senior Notes will mature on December 1, 2024, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Company may not redeem the Senior Notes at its option prior to maturity. In addition, if the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the required repurchase date. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $5,082 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. Convertible Unsecured Note On February 25, 2019, the Company issued a $4,000 convertible unsecured note (the “Unsecured Note”), maturing on June 29, 2023, to Bassian Farms, Inc. (the “Holder”) as partial consideration in the Bassian acquisition. The interest rate charged on the Unsecured Note is 4.5% per annum and increases to 5.0% after the two-year anniversary of the closing date. The Company may, in certain instances beginning eighteen months after issuance of the Unsecured Note, redeem the Unsecured Note in whole or in part for cash or convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price of $43.93 per share. After the two-year anniversary of the closing date, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price. Upon a change of control event, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price or redeem the Unsecured Note for cash.",

earnings was $ 3.77 billion for 2018 , 28% ( 28 % ) higher than 2017 , reflecting an increase in interest income primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on collateralized agreements , other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks , increases in total average loans receivable and financial instruments owned , and higher yields on financial instruments owned and loans receivable . the increase in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-bearing liabilities , collateralized

earnings was $ 3.77 billion for 2018 , 28% ( 28 % ) higher than 2017 , reflecting an increase in interest income primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on collateralized agreements , other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks , increases in total average loans receivable and financial instruments owned , and higher yields on financial instruments owned and loans receivable . the increase in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-bearing liabilities , collateralized financings , deposits and long-term borrowings , and increases in total average long-term borrowings and deposits . see 201cstatistical disclosures 2014 distribution of assets , liabilities and

        "context": "\n<image 1>\n Other non-operating results The following details our other consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Interest expense: Interest expense increased by $1.2 million to $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $101.9 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to:\n• $28.9 million lower capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in the Hilli FLNG conversion following acceptance of the vessel by the charterer in May 2018; and\n• $1.5 million interest on the term loan facility, drawn in September 2019. This was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to lower LIBOR rates, resulting in:\n• $12.4 million decrease in interest expense arising on the loan facilities of our consolidated lessor VIEs;\n• $8.7 million capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investments;\n• $6.5 million decrease in interest expense incurred on the deposits received from Golar Partners following application of the deposit to the Hilli acquisition price and the conversion of the Hilli shareholder loans to equity following the Hilli Disposal in July 2018; and\n• $1.0 million decrease in interest expense on the Hilli letter of credit, due to a contractual step down in the Hilli letter of credit from $300 million to $250 million in May 2019, and a further step down to $125 million in November 2019. Losses on derivative instruments: Losses on derivative instruments increased by $7.5 million to a loss of $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.5 million for the same period in 2018. The movement was primarily due to: Net unrealized and realized (losses)/gains on interest rate swap agreements: As of December 31, 2019, we have an interest rate swap portfolio with a notional amount of $737.5 million, none of which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Net unrealized losses on the interest rate swaps increased to a loss of $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a gain of $0.6 million for the same period in 2018, due to a decline in the long-term swap rates, partially offset by the decreased notional value of our swap portfolio over the period. Realized gains on our interest rate swaps decreased to a gain of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a gain of $8.1 million for the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower LIBOR rates for the year ended December 31, 2019. Unrealized losses on Total Return Swap: In December 2014, we established a three month facility for a Stock Indexed Total Return Swap Programme or Equity Swap Line with DNB Bank ASA in connection with a share buyback scheme. In November 2019, we repurchased 1.5 million shares underlying the equity swap. The remaining facility has been extended to March 2020. The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.5 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.7 million for the same period in 2018. The losses in 2019 and 2018 are due to the decline in our share price. Unrealized mark-to-market losses on Earn-Out Units: This relates to the mark-to-market movement on the Earn-Out Units issuable in connection with the IDR reset transaction in October 2016, which we recognize as a derivative asset in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in Golar Partners' quarterly distribution to $0.4042 per common unit on October 24, 2018 resulted in the contingent Earn-Out Units arising out of the IDR reset transaction in October 2016 not crystallizing and, accordingly, we recognized a mark-to-market loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, effectively reducing the derivative asset to $nil at December 31, 2018. There was no comparative movement for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other financial items, net: Other financial items, net decreased by $4.0 million to a loss of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of consolidating our lessor VIEs. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased by $26.4 million to $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $63.2 million for the same period in 2018 mainly due to the completion of the Hilli Disposal in July 2018. The non-controlling interest in relation to the Hilli Disposal for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $61.7 million, compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2018. The net income attributable to non-controlling interests comprises of: • $36.5 million and $19.7 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Hilli LLC for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively; • $0.5 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Gimi MS Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019, following the subscription of 30% equity interest by First FLNG Holdings in April 2019; and • $28.3 million and $31.9 million in relation to the equity interests in our remaining lessor VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.",

The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.5 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.7 million for the same period in 2018. The losses in 2019 and 2018 are due to the decline in our share price. Unrealized mark-to-market losses on Earn-Out Units: This relates to the mark-to-market movement on the Earn-Out Units issuable in connection with the IDR reset transaction in October 2016, which we recognize as a derivative asset in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in Golar Partners' quarterly distribution to $0.4042 per common unit on October 24, 2018 resulted in the contingent Earn-Out Units arising out of the IDR reset transaction in October 2016 not crystallizing and, accordingly, we recognized a mark-to-market loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, effectively reducing the derivative asset to $nil at December 31, 2018. There was no comparative movement for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other financial items, net: Other financial items, net decreased by $4.0 million to a loss of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2018 primarily as a result of consolidating our lessor VIEs. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased by $26.4 million to $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $63.2 million for the same period in 2018 mainly due to the completion of the Hilli Disposal in July 2018. The non-controlling interest in relation to the Hilli Disposal for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $61.7 million, compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2018. The net income attributable to non-controlling interests comprises of: • $36.5 million and $19.7 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Hilli LLC for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively; • $0.5 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Gimi MS Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019, following the subscription of 30% equity interest by First FLNG Holdings in April 2019; and • $28.3 million and $31.9 million in relation to the equity interests in our remaining lessor VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nQuestion: What would be the percentage change in net income attributable in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Hilli LLC if the amount in 2019 is $28.3 million? (in percent)\n\nPlease generate a Python program to answer the given question based on the provided image and context.

        "context": "\n<image 1>\n Acquisitions and divestments\nAcquisitions In 2019, Ericsson made acquisitions with a negative cash flow effect amounting to SEK 1,815 (1,220) million. The acquisitions presented below are not material, but the Company gives the information to provide the reader a summarized view of the content of the acquisitions made. The acquisitions consist primarily of: Kathrein: On October 2, 2019, the Company acquired assets from Kathrein, a world leading provider of antenna and filter technologies with approximately 4,000 employees. Kathrein’s antenna and filters business has a strong R&D organization with extensive experience in antenna design and research, coupled with a strong IPR portfolio. In addition to broadening Ericsson’s portfolio of antenna and filter products, the acquisition will bring vital competence for the evolution of advanced radio network products. The acquired Kathrein business has had a negative impact of SEK –0.5 billion since the acquisition, corresponding to –1 percentage point in Networks operating margin. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are preliminary. CSF: On August 20, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in CSF Holdings Inc. a US-based technology company with approximately 25 employees. CSF strengthens iconectiv’s Business to Consumer (B2C) product platforms to enable growth in messaging and Toll-Free Number (TFN) management. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are final. ST-Ericsson: Before ST-Ericsson was a joint venture where Ericsson and ST Microelectronics had a 50/50 ownership. This joint venture consisted of a number of legal entities where the two parties owned different stakes in the different legal entities. In December 2019 the Company initiated transactions to wind-down the legal structure of ST-Ericsson by acquiring the remaining shares in two legal ST-Ericsson entities and costs of SEK –0.3 billion impacted the result. The Company now owns 100% of the shares in those entities. In order to finalize a Purchase price allocation all relevant information needs to be in place. Examples of such information are final consideration and final opening balances, they may remain preliminary for a period of time due\nto for example adjustments of working capital, tax items or decisions from local authorities. 1) Acquisition-related costs are included in Selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.",

asset exceeds its fair value . software costs 2013 we capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended . capitalized software costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software and compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project . capitalized software costs are included in property , plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software ,

ACQUISITIONS MGI On April 4, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets comprising the business of MGI Grain Processing, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, now conducting business as MGI Grain Incorporated (MGI) for an aggregate purchase price of $3.8 million. The purchase price included $0.3 million deposited in an escrow account at closing which was subsequently released to the sellers in June 2019. MGI owns and operates a grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. We acquired MGI as part of our strategy to expand our product portfolio. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of MGI’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning April 4, 2019. In 2019, we incurred $0.1 million of MGI acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The purchase price for MGI was subject to adjustment if the estimated closing working capital with respect to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed was different than the actual closing working capital, as defined in the purchase agreement. The seller of MGI paid a working capital adjustment of $18 thousand in 2019. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation, the consideration transferred to acquire MGI and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands). In the fourth quarter of 2019, our appraiser finalized certain fair value calculations and we completed our review of the calculations. The fair value of MGI’s trade receivables at acquisition, equaled the gross amount of trade receivables. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible at acquisition was estimated using an income approach based on expected future cash flows. As discussed in Note 9, we are amortizing the customer relationship intangible to expense over the 15-year period of expected future economic benefit, in proportion to the discounted expected future cash flows used to estimate the value of the intangible at acquisition. Goodwill primarily was attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and synergies generated by MGI when combined with our existing operations. The $0.7 million allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over the next fifteen years.",

The seller of MGI paid a working capital adjustment of $18 thousand in 2019. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation, the consideration transferred to acquire MGI and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands). In the fourth quarter of 2019, our appraiser finalized certain fair value calculations and we completed our review of the calculations. The fair value of MGI’s trade receivables at acquisition, equaled the gross amount of trade receivables. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible at acquisition was estimated using an income approach based on expected future cash flows. As discussed in Note 9, we are amortizing the customer relationship intangible to expense over the 15-year period of expected future economic benefit, in proportion to the discounted expected future cash flows used to estimate the value of the intangible at acquisition. Goodwill primarily was attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and synergies generated by MGI when combined with our existing operations. The $0.7 million allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over the next fifteen years.",

ACQUISITIONS MGI On April 4, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets comprising the business of MGI Grain Processing, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, now conducting business as MGI Grain Incorporated (MGI) for an aggregate purchase price of $3.8 million. The purchase price included $0.3 million deposited in an escrow account at closing which was subsequently released to the sellers in June 2019. MGI owns and operates a grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. We acquired MGI as part of our strategy to expand our product portfolio. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of MGI’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning April 4, 2019.

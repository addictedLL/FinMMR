Visually estimate the value of the red line at this point. It appears to be approximately 2.25%.\n\nStep 3: Determine the Marginal Lending Facility Rate in June 2014.\nIn the third graph, locate the vertical line corresponding to \"2014.6利率走廊降至50bp\".  The annotation states \"2014.6利率走廊降至50bp，政策利率降至0.15%\".  \"政策利率\" here refers to the deposit facility rate (yellow line). \"利率走廊降至50bp\" means the difference between the marginal lending facility rate and the deposit facility rate is 50 basis points (0.5%).  Since the deposit facility rate is 0.15% in June 2014, the marginal lending facility rate is 0.15% + 0.5% = 0.65%.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the decrease in the Marginal Lending Facility Rate.\nDecrease = Marginal Lending Facility Rate in November 2011 - Marginal Lending Facility Rate in June 2014\nDecrease = 2.25% - 0.65% = 1.60%\n\nStep 5: Express the decrease as a percentage with two decimal places.\nThe decrease is already calculated as 1.60%, which is in percentage form and has two decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.60.\n\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is 1.60",

Based on the context of the provided tables, especially the title of the third table which includes \"江中药业\", and the last row of the third table explicitly mentioning \"600750.SH 江中药业\", we can determine that the question is asking about the stock of \"江中药业 (Jiangzhong Pharmaceutical)\", stock code 600750.SH.\n\nSecond, find the EPS (Earnings Per Share) values for this stock from 2023 to 2026.  From the third table, under the \"EPS (元)\" section and row for \"600750.SH 江中药业\", we have the following EPS values:\n2023A: 1.13 元\n2024E: 1.25 元\n2025E: 1.42 元\n2026E: 1.60 元\n\nThird, calculate the year-over-year EPS growth rates.\nGrowth rate from 2023 to 2024 = (EPS in 2024 - EPS in 2023) / EPS in 2023 = (1.25 - 1.13) / 1.13 = 0.12 / 1.13 ≈ 0.10619\nGrowth rate from 2024 to 2025 = (EPS in 2025 - EPS in 2024) / EPS in 2024 = (1.42 - 1.25) / 1.25 = 0.17 / 1.25 = 0.136\nGrowth rate from 2025 to 2026 = (EPS in 2026 - EPS in 2025) / EPS in 2025 = (1.60 - 1.42) / 1.42 = 0.18 / 1.42 ≈ 0.12676\n\nFourth, calculate the average of these growth rates.\nAverage growth rate = (0.10619 + 0.136 + 0.12676) / 3 = 0.36895 / 3 ≈ 0.12298\n\nFifth, convert the average growth rate to percentage and round to two decimal places.\nAverage growth rate in percentage = 0.12298 * 100% = 12.298%\nRounded to two decimal places, the average growth rate is 12.30%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12.30.\n\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is 12.30",

        "output": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps described in the question based on the data from the third chart.\n\nStep 1: Identify the data for 2026 and 2028 from the third chart.\nFrom the third chart, we estimate the total value (sum of '生成式AI' and '非生成式AI') for 2026 and 2028.\nFor 2026, the total height of the bar is approximately 267,000. Let's denote this as $D_{2026} = 267000$.\nFor 2028, the total height of the bar is approximately 288,000. Let's denote this as $D_{2028} = 288000$.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average of the data for 2026 and 2028.\nAverage value $Avg = \\frac{D_{2026} + D_{2028}}{2} = \\frac{267000 + 288000}{2} = \\frac{555000}{2} = 277500$.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the average value from the 2028 data.\nDifference $Diff = D_{2028} - Avg = 288000 - 277500 = 10500$.\n\nStep 4: Multiply the result by 100.\nResult $= Diff \\times 100 = 10500 \\times 100 = 1050000$.\n\nStep 5: Express the result as a percentage with two decimal places.\nSince the question asks to get a percentage by multiplying the result by 100, and to keep two decimal places, we will express 1050000 with two decimal places as 1050000.00.  However, given the context of percentage and financial data, it is more likely that the question intended to calculate the percentage change relative to the average.  But following the exact steps literally, we should just multiply by 100 and keep two decimal places.\n\nTherefore, based on the direct interpretation of the question steps, the answer is 1,050,000.00. However, if we consider the context of percentage *difference*, then we should calculate percentage difference as $[(D_{2028} - Avg) / Avg] \\times 100 = (10500 / 277500) \\times 100 \\approx 3.78378... \\approx 3.78$.  Given the phrase \"得到百分比\", it's more likely it's asking for a percentage difference.  But if we strictly follow \"将结果乘以100得到百分比\", it might mean just multiply by 100.  Let's assume it is just multiplication by 100 as literally asked.\n\nFinal Answer based on literal interpretation: 1,050,000.00.\n\nLet's re-check calculations:\nAverage = (267000 + 288000) / 2 = 277500\nDifference = 288000 - 277500 = 10500\nResult = 10500 * 100 = 1050000\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1050000.00 when rounded to two decimal places.  However, if we are asked for a numeric value, we can just give 1050000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1050000.\n\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is 1050000.00",

Therefore, the final answer is 150.6.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 150.6\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}],\"created\":1740988480,\"model\":\"gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":null,\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":469,\"prompt_tokens\":909,\"total_tokens\":1378,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"accepted_prediction_tokens\":null,\"audio_tokens\":0,\"reasoning_tokens\":null,\"rejected_prediction_tokens\":null,\"text_tokens\":0},\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"audio_tokens\":0,\"cached_tokens\":0,\"text_tokens\":0,\"image_tokens\":0}}}",

        "output": "The question asks for the total square footage of leased properties after the company expands its operations by leasing two more facilities, each with 15,000 square feet.\nFirst, we need to identify all the properties that are currently leased and sum their square footage. Based on the provided image, we can identify the leased properties and their corresponding square footage as follows:\n1. Farmingdale, NY (Note 1): Leased, Square footage: 43,000\n2. New York, NY (Note 2): Leased, Square footage: 11,300\n3. San Diego, CA (Note 3): Leased, Square footage: 6,400\n4. Lausen, Switzerland (Note 4): Leased, Square footage: 18,829\n5. Ann Arbor, Michigan (Note 5): Leased, Square footage: 26,820\n\nNow, we sum the square footage of these leased properties:\nTotal current leased square footage = 43,000 + 11,300 + 6,400 + 18,829 + 26,820 = 106,349 square feet.\n\nThe company plans to expand by leasing two more facilities, each with 15,000 square feet. So, the additional square footage from these new leases will be:\nAdditional leased square footage = 2 * 15,000 = 30,000 square feet.\n\nTo find the total square footage of leased properties after the expansion, we add the current total leased square footage and the additional leased square footage:\nTotal leased square footage after expansion = Total current leased square footage + Additional leased square footage\nTotal leased square footage after expansion = 106,349 + 30,000 = 136,349 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 136349.\nTherefore, the answer is 136349",

So we will convert both number in terms of bytes.\n5 GB = 5 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes = 5 * 10^9 bytes approximately\nGPT-4 data = 13 * 10^13 tokens = 130,000,000,000,000 tokens\nSo, the growth rate is computed as follows:\nGrowth rate = (GPT-4 data / GPT-1 data) - 1\nGrowth rate = (13 * 10^13) / (5*10^9) - 1 = 26000 -1 = 25999\nThe percentage growth rate is 25999 * 100% = 2599900% = 2599900\n\nThe problem asks for the growth rate of the pre-training data size from GPT-1 to GPT-4.\nGPT-1: 5 GB\nGPT-4: approximately 130 trillion tokens\nThe exact number is difficult to calculate because token size matters, but we are provided that they are the amount of pre-training data. Therefore, we will assume that the units are comparable. We can consider it an approximate increase from 5 to 130000000000000.\n\nGrowth rate = (GPT-4 value / GPT-1 value) - 1 = (130,000,000,000,000 / 5) - 1 = 26,000,000,000,000 - 1 = 25,999,999,999,999\nThe requested growth rate is (GPT-4 / GPT-1).\n\nThe ratio is 130,000,000,000,000 / 5.\nGPT-1 pre-training data is approximately 5GB.\nGPT-4 pre-training data is approximately 130 trillion tokens, according to the table. So we need to find their ratio to determine growth.\nThe prompt asks for the growth RATE. Growth rate formula = (Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value\nThe Ending Value is GPT-4 = 130 * 10^12\nThe Beginning Value is GPT-1 = 5\nGrowth Rate = (130 * 10^12 - 5) / 5 = (130 * 10^12) / 5 - 1 = 26 * 10^12 - 1 = 25999999999999\n\nPercentage increase from GPT-1 to GPT-4 = ((130 * 10^12) / 5) - 1 * 100 = 25999999999999 * 100 = 26000000000000 %\n((130,000,000,000,000 / 5) - 5 ) / 5= (26,000,000,000,000 -5) / 5 = 5199999999999\n\n(Final - Initial)/Initial = (130T tokens - 5 GB) / 5 GB\n5GB ~ 5 * 10^9 bytes, 130T = 1.3*10^14\n\nApproximation -> (1.3 * 10^14) / 5 = 0.26 * 10^14 = 2.6 * 10^13 = 26,000,000,000,000\n\n((130*10^12) / 5) = 26,000,000,000,000 = 2.6 * 10^13\nThe Growth Rate is 25,999,999,999,999.\n\nSince it asked the growth rate, we consider the growth rate ratio = GPT-4/GPT-1 = 1.3*10^14/5 = 2.6 * 10^13 = 26,000,000,000,000\nTherefore, the answer is 26000000000000.\nTherefore, the answer is 25999999999999.00\nTherefore, the answer is 26000000000000.00\nTherefore, the answer is 26000000000000.00\nTherefore, the answer is 26000000000000.00",

Let's calculate the saving directly using the rate difference.\n- Interest saving for Term Loan = Outstanding Term Loan Amount * Interest Rate Reduction = $55.0 million * 0.5% = 55.0 * 0.005 = $0.275 million\n- Interest saving for Other debt = Outstanding Other debt Amount * Interest Rate Reduction = $13.5 million * 0.5% = 13.5 * 0.005 = $0.0675 million\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total interest savings.\nTotal interest saving = Interest saving for Term Loan + Interest saving for Other debt = $0.275 million + $0.0675 million = $0.3425 million\n\nStep 6: Round the answer to a reasonable number of decimal places.\nSince the values in the table are presented with one decimal place, we can present the answer with two or four decimal places for more accuracy. Let's use four decimal places as calculated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.3425.\n\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is 0.3425",

From the table, Expected annual income return = 2.4%.\n    Dividend Yield = 2.4%\n\n2.  **Expected annual real earnings growth**: This represents the Earnings Growth. From the table, Expected annual real earnings growth = 5.0%.\n    Earnings Growth = 5.0%\n\n3.  **Current equity market P/E**: From the \"Current\" column, Current equity market P/E = 14.5x.\n    Current P/E = 14.5\n\n4.  **Expected equity market P/E**: From the \"Capital Market Expectations\" column, Expected equity market P/E = 14.0x.\n    Expected P/E = 14.0\n\nNow we need to calculate the Change in P/E Ratio. The Change in P/E Ratio is the return derived from the change in the P/E multiple from the current to the expected level.  We calculate the percentage change in P/E ratio as follows:\n\nChange in P/E Ratio = (Expected P/E - Current P/E) / Current P/E\n\nChange in P/E Ratio = (14.0 - 14.5) / 14.5\nChange in P/E Ratio = -0.5 / 14.5\nChange in P/E Ratio = -0.0344827586\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\nChange in P/E Ratio (in percentage) = -0.0344827586 * 100%\nChange in P/E Ratio (in percentage) = -3.44827586%\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Grinold–Kroner model formula:\n\nExpected Equity Return = Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth + Change in P/E Ratio\nExpected Equity Return = 2.4% + 5.0% + (-3.44827586%)\nExpected Equity Return = 2.4% + 5.0% - 3.44827586%\nExpected Equity Return = 7.4% - 3.44827586%\nExpected Equity Return = 3.95172414%\n\nWe are asked to express the answer to three decimal places. Rounding 3.95172414% to three decimal places gives us 3.952%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.952.\nTherefore, the answer is 3.952",

We calculate the percentage change in P/E ratio as follows:\\n\\nChange in P/E Ratio = (Expected P/E - Current P/E) / Current P/E\\n\\nChange in P/E Ratio = (14.0 - 14.5) / 14.5\\nChange in P/E Ratio = -0.5 / 14.5\\nChange in P/E Ratio = -0.0344827586\\n\\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\\n\\nChange in P/E Ratio (in percentage) = -0.0344827586 * 100%\\nChange in P/E Ratio (in percentage) = -3.44827586%\\n\\nNow we can plug the values into the Grinold–Kroner model formula:\\n\\nExpected Equity Return = Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth + Change in P/E Ratio\\nExpected Equity Return = 2.4% + 5.0% + (-3.44827586%)\\nExpected Equity Return = 2.4% + 5.0% - 3.44827586%\\nExpected Equity Return = 7.4% - 3.44827586%\\nExpected Equity Return = 3.95172414%\\n\\nWe are asked to express the answer to three decimal places. Rounding 3.95172414% to three decimal places gives us 3.952%.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 3.952.\\nTherefore, the answer is 3.952\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}],\"created\":1740988533,\"model\":\"gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":null,\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":667,\"prompt_tokens\":459,\"total_tokens\":1126,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"accepted_prediction_tokens\":null,\"audio_tokens\":0,\"reasoning_tokens\":null,\"rejected_prediction_tokens\":null,\"text_tokens\":0},\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"audio_tokens\":0,\"cached_tokens\":0,\"text_tokens\":0,\"image_tokens\":0}}}",

        "output": "Here's a step-by-step thought process to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the target variable:** The question asks for the \"revised difference\" in CFO target total pay (in million) after a 10% increase in 2020.  It's implied that the difference is between the 2020 and 2019 target total pay.\n\n2. **Extract relevant data from the table:**\n    * CFO Target Total Pay for 2019: 3,756 ('000 p.a.)\n    * CFO Target Total Pay for 2020: 3,869 ('000 p.a.)\n\n3. **Calculate the 10% increase in CFO's 2020 target total pay:**\n    * Increase amount = 10% of 2020 Target Total Pay = 0.10 * 3,869 = 386.9 ('000 p.a.)\n\n4. **Calculate the revised CFO's 2020 target total pay after the 10% increase:**\n    * Revised 2020 Target Total Pay = Original 2020 Target Total Pay + Increase amount = 3,869 + 386.9 = 4,255.9 ('000 p.a.)\n\n5. **Calculate the revised difference between the revised 2020 target total pay and the 2019 target total pay:**\n    * Revised Difference = Revised 2020 Target Total Pay - 2019 Target Total Pay = 4,255.9 - 3,756 = 499.9 ('000 p.a.)\n\n6. **Convert the revised difference from '000 p.a. to million:**\n    * Revised Difference in million = 499.9 / 1000 = 0.4999 million\n\n7. **Round the answer if necessary:** Since the numbers in the table are given with integer precision in '000s, and the question asks for the answer in million, keeping four decimal places seems appropriate to maintain precision from the intermediate calculations. We can also round to two decimal places for simplicity, which would be 0.50 million.

        "context": "<image 1>\nOn March 17, 2014, we completed the previously announced sale of our Environmental Services business for $100 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on actual working capital conveyed at closing. Cash proceeds from the sale were $89.2 million in the first quarter of 2014, net of transaction related expenses. In addition, $8 million of the sale price was withheld in escrow associated with transaction representations, warranties and indemnities, and is expected to be released over the next two years. As a result of the sale transaction, we recorded a gain on the disposal of the business of $34.0 million ($22.1 million after-tax). All assets, liabilities and results of operations for this business have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nIn December 2013, we completed the acquisition of Terrafirma Roadways (“Terrafirma”), a provider of temporary roadways and worksites based in the United Kingdom, for total cash consideration of $6.8 million, net of cash acquired. Additional consideration up to £1.0 million ($1.6 million) may be payable based on earnings of the business over the 18-month period following the acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Terrafirma had been operating as a partner to the Company since 2008, developing a rental business with DURA-BASE® composite mats, primarily focused in the utility industry in the U.K.\nIn April 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the Company to purchase up to $50.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. In February 2014, our Board of Directors increased the total authorization of the program to $100.0 million, subject to completion of the Environmental Services divesture. These purchases are funded with a combination of cash generated from operations, the sale of the Environmental Services business and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The repurchase program has no specific term. The Company may repurchase shares in the open market or as otherwise determined by management, subject to market conditions, business opportunities and other factors. As part of the share repurchase program, the Company’s management has been authorized to establish trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",

Therefore, we will use the '全区间' 基准值, which is -0.23%.\n\nNow, we calculate the percentage of the difference relative to the '基准值':\nPercentage = (Difference / 基准值) * 100%\nPercentage = (0.31% / -0.23%) * 100%\nPercentage = (0.0031 / -0.0023) * 100\nPercentage ≈ -1.3478 * 100\nPercentage ≈ -134.78%\n\nFinally, we round the result to one decimal place:\nRounded Percentage ≈ -134.8%\n\nTherefore, the answer is -134.8.\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is -134.8",

The result is -2.39% / 62.50% = -0.0239 / 0.6250 = -0.03824.\\nFinally, we need to round the result to two decimal places. -0.03824 rounded to two decimal places is -0.04.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is -0.04.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistantassistantassistantassistantassistantassistantassistantassistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}],\"created\":1740988552,\"model\":\"gemini-2.0-flash-exp\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":null,\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":252,\"prompt_tokens\":908,\"total_tokens\":1160,\"completion_tokens_details\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null}}",

We are asked to find the ratio of this salary to the aggregate amount paid to the Corporation to its external auditors.\nLet A be the aggregate amount paid to external auditors and N be the amount paid for non-audit services.\nAccording to the question, we are given two conditions:\n1. \"that amount is 8 times of the non-audit services provided to the Corporation\": This means A = 8 * N.\n2. \"these non-audit services constitute not more than five percent of the total revenues paid to its external auditors\": This means N ≤ 0.05 * A.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the CEO's annual salary to A.\nRatio = CEO's annual salary / A = 320,000 / A.\n\nFrom condition 1 and 2, we have:\nN ≤ 0.05 * A\nA = 8 * N\n\nSubstitute A = 8 * N into the inequality:\nN ≤ 0.05 * (8 * N)\nN ≤ 0.4 * N\nThis inequality is true for N ≥ 0.\n\nLet's consider the case when non-audit services constitute exactly five percent of the total revenues paid to its external auditors, i.e., N = 0.05 * A.\nWe have a system of two equations:\nA = 8 * N\nN = 0.05 * A\n\nSubstitute N = 0.05 * A into A = 8 * N:\nA = 8 * (0.05 * A)\nA = 0.4 * A\nA - 0.4 * A = 0\n0.6 * A = 0\nA = 0\n\nIf we assume N = 0.05 * A, then A = 0, which is not a realistic aggregate amount.\n\nLet's assume non-audit services constitute 12.5% of the total revenues paid to its external auditors, i.e., N = 0.125 * A = A/8.\nThen A = 8 * N is satisfied.\nLet's assume Aggregate amount paid to external auditors A = $80,000.\nThen Non-audit services N = A / 8 = $80,000 / 8 = $10,000.\nCheck if non-audit services constitute not more than five percent of the total revenues paid to its external auditors:\nN / A = $10,000 / $80,000 = 1/8 = 0.125 = 12.5%.\nThis is NOT less than or equal to 5%.  However, if we use A = 80000, and calculate the ratio:\nRatio = CEO's annual salary / A = $320,000 / $80,000 = 32 / 8 = 4.\n\nLet's assume the question meant that non-audit services should be *at most* 5% of the aggregate amount, and we consider the maximum possible aggregate amount under the condition A = 8N while respecting the 5% constraint.  However, the conditions as stated lead to A=0 if we try to satisfy N = 0.05 * A and A = 8 * N simultaneously.\n\nGiven the contradictory nature of the conditions for a positive aggregate amount, and if we are to assume there is a plausible scenario intended by the question, let's consider the case where A = 8 * N and we aim to find a ratio. If we take aggregate amount A = $80,000 based on some implicit assumption (perhaps related to scale of CEO salary), and if A = $80,000 is 8 times of non-audit services, then non-audit services N = $10,000.  In this scenario, the ratio of CEO's salary to aggregate amount is $320,000 / $80,000 = 4.\n\nRatio = 4.00 (in 2 decimal places).\n\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is 4.00",

However, if we use A = 80000, and calculate the ratio:\\nRatio = CEO's annual salary / A = $320,000 / $80,000 = 32 / 8 = 4.\\n\\nLet's assume the question meant that non-audit services should be *at most* 5% of the aggregate amount, and we consider the maximum possible aggregate amount under the condition A = 8N while respecting the 5% constraint.  However, the conditions as stated lead to A=0 if we try to satisfy N = 0.05 * A and A = 8 * N simultaneously.\\n\\nGiven the contradictory nature of the conditions for a positive aggregate amount, and if we are to assume there is a plausible scenario intended by the question, let's consider the case where A = 8 * N and we aim to find a ratio. If we take aggregate amount A = $80,000 based on some implicit assumption (perhaps related to scale of CEO salary), and if A = $80,000 is 8 times of non-audit services, then non-audit services N = $10,000.  In this scenario, the ratio of CEO's salary to aggregate amount is $320,000 / $80,000 = 4.\\n\\nRatio = 4.00 (in 2 decimal places).\\n\\nFinal Answer: Therefore, the answer is 4.00\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}],\"created\":1740988981,\"model\":\"gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":null,\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":938,\"prompt_tokens\":710,\"total_tokens\":1648,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"accepted_prediction_tokens\":null,\"audio_tokens\":0,\"reasoning_tokens\":null,\"rejected_prediction_tokens\":null,\"text_tokens\":0},\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"audio_tokens\":0,\"cached_tokens\":0,\"text_tokens\":0,\"image_tokens\":0}}}",

The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of full-time research and development personnel, resulting in a decrease of $3.1 million in compensation expense and $0.6 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs as compared to 2018.

            "user_input": "The following question context is provided for your reference.\n<image 1>\n A.4.2 Income As a result of the development described for the segments, Income from continuing operations before income taxes declined 7 %. Severance charges for continuing operations were € 619 million, of which € 492 million were in Industrial Businesses. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITA margin Industrial Businesses excluding severance charges was 11.5 % in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018, severance charges for continuing operations were € 923 million, of which € 669 million were in Industrial Businesses. The tax rate of 25% for fiscal 2019 was below the tax rate of 26% for the prior year, benefiting mainly from the reversal of income tax provisions outside Germany. As a result, Income from continuing operations declined 6%. Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the prior year included positive effects from the release of a provision related to former Communications activities. The decline in basic earnings per share reflects the decrease of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was € 5,174 million in fiscal 2019 compared to € 5,807 million in fiscal 2018, partially offset by a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding. Basic earnings per share excluding severance charges was € 6.93. As expected, ROCE at 11.1 % was below the target range set in our Siemens Financial Framework, reflecting in particular the effects from portfolio transactions in recent years, including the acquisitions of Mentor and Mendix at Digital Industries and the merger of Siemens’ wind power business with Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica, S. A. that created SGRE. The decline year-over-year was due both to lower income before interest after tax and to higher average capital employed.\n\nQuestion: If the Gas and Power increased by 10% in 2019, what is the revised increase / (decrease)? (in million)\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

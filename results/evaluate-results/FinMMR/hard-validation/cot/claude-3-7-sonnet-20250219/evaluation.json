NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued) (in thousands, except per share amounts) We account for uncertain tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold to tax positions before recognizing these positions in the financial statements. The reconciliation of our total gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: The unrecognized tax benefits of $13.0 million, if recognized, will impact the Company’s effective tax rate. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. We had $3.0 million and $1.2 million of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect the total amount of tax contingencies will decrease by approximately $3.5 million in 2020 based on statute of limitation expiration. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016.",

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued) (in thousands, except per share amounts) We account for uncertain tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold to tax positions before recognizing these positions in the financial statements. The reconciliation of our total gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: The unrecognized tax benefits of $13.0 million, if recognized, will impact the Company’s effective tax rate. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. We had $3.0 million and $1.2 million of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect the total amount of tax contingencies will decrease by approximately $3.5 million in 2020 based on statute of limitation expiration. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016.\n\nQuestion: What was the percentage change in the Reductions related to a lapse of applicable statute of limitations between 2017 and 2018?

We did not incur restructuring costs in 2019, as compared to 2018 when $0.1 million was incurred as part of the 2018 Restructuring Plan (refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of full-time research and development personnel, resulting in a decrease of $3.1 million in compensation expense and $0.6 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs as compared to 2018. We did not incur restructuring costs in 2019, as compared to 2018 when $0.1 million was incurred as part of the 2018 Restructuring Plan (refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Finally, the decrease was further driven by lower professional fees of $0.6 million, as we reduced the number of research and development contractors as compared to 2018.\n\nQuestion: What would be the total research and development expenses in 2018 and 2019 if the value of the 2019 expenses is decreased by 10%?

associated with the transferred assets . commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations we originate , close and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to fnma under fnma 2019s dus program . we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc . under these programs , we generally assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement . at december 31 , 2012 and december 31 , 2011 , the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs was $ 12.8 billion and $ 13.0 billion , respectively . the potential maximum exposure under the loss share arrangements was $ 3.9 billion at december 31 , 2012 and $ 4.0 billion at december 31 , 2011 . we maintain a reserve for estimated losses based upon our exposure . the reserve for losses under these programs totaled $ 43 million and $ 47 million as of december 31 , 2012 and december 31 , 2011 , respectively , and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet . if payment is required under these programs , we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred , although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses . our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the corporate & institutional banking segment . table 154 : analysis of commercial mortgage recourse obligations .\n\n<image 1>\n\nresidential mortgage loan and home equity repurchase obligations while residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis , we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors . these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements . residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations , non-agency securitizations , and loan sale transactions . as discussed in note 3 loans sale and servicing activities and 228 the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k .\n\n\nQuestion: for 2011 and 2012, what were the average commercial mortgage recourse obligations in millions?

Basic earnings per share excluding severance charges was € 6.93. As expected, ROCE at 11.1 % was below the target range set in our Siemens Financial Framework, reflecting in particular the effects from portfolio transactions in recent years, including the acquisitions of Mentor and Mendix at Digital Industries and the merger of Siemens’ wind power business with Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica, S. A. that created SGRE. The decline year-over-year was due both to lower income before interest after tax and to higher average capital employed.",

The decline in basic earnings per share reflects the decrease of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was € 5,174 million in fiscal 2019 compared to € 5,807 million in fiscal 2018, partially offset by a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding. Basic earnings per share excluding severance charges was € 6.93. As expected, ROCE at 11.1 % was below the target range set in our Siemens Financial Framework, reflecting in particular the effects from portfolio transactions in recent years, including the acquisitions of Mentor and Mendix at Digital Industries and the merger of Siemens’ wind power business with Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica, S. A. that created SGRE. The decline year-over-year was due both to lower income before interest after tax and to higher average capital employed.\n\nQuestion: If the Gas and Power increased by 10% in 2019, what is the revised increase / (decrease)? (in million)\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

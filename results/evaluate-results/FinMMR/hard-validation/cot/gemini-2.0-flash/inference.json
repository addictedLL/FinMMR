This assumption will not impact our final answer as the question asks to compute annual rental payments for Machine B as if the financial manager were renting Machine B to the production manager for that machine's economic life and ignores taxes.\\n\\nThe present value of Machine B's costs is:\\nPV = 50000 + 8000/(1.06) + 8000/(1.06)^2 + 8000/(1.06)^3 + 8000/(1.06)^4\\nPV = 50000 + 7547.17 + 7120.0 + 6716.98 + 6336.77\\nPV = 77720.92\\n\\nWe want to find an annual payment (A) such that the present value of 4 years of payments is equal to the present value of Machine B's costs.\\nPV = A/(1.06) + A/(1.06)^2 + A/(1.06)^3 + A/(1.06)^4\\n77720.92 = A * [1/(1.06) + 1/(1.06)^2 + 1/(1.06)^3 + 1/(1.06)^4]\\n77720.92 = A * [0.9434 + 0.8900 + 0.8396 + 0.7921]\\n77720.92 = A * 3.4651\\nA = 77720.92 / 3.4651\\nA = 22430.0\\n\\nThe annual rental payment would have to be approximately $22,430.0.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 22430.0\\n\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}],\"created\":1740933252,\"model\":\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":null,\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":580,\"prompt_tokens\":1233,\"total_tokens\":1813,\"completion_tokens_details\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null}}"

The net effect on shares outstanding was 176 million at the time of acquisition. The shares outstanding as of Dec 31, 2012 includes the effect of Smith International. Thus, to get the shares outstanding without the acquisition, we need to subtract the 100 - 76 = 176 from the initial balance. Thus, the shares outstanding would have been 1,328 - 176 = 1,152.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 1152.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}],\"created\":1740933273,\"model\":\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":null,\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":195,\"prompt_tokens\":3528,\"total_tokens\":3723,\"completion_tokens_details\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null}}"

All securities have been in circulation for the complete year. What is the diluted earnings per share for this corporation? Answer to three decimal places.",
        "context": "",
        "output": "Let's calculate the diluted earnings per share. First, we need to calculate the net income available to common shareholders. We are given the net income for the year which is $1,500,000. We also have cumulative preferred stock with a par value of $2,000,000 and a 7% dividend rate. So, the preferred dividend is $2,000,000 * 0.07 = $140,000.\n\nThe income available to common shareholders is $1,500,000 - $140,000 = $1,360,000.\n\nNext, consider the convertible bonds. The par value of convertible bonds is $10,000,000 with a 4% coupon rate. The interest expense is $10,000,000 * 0.04 = $400,000. Since the bonds are convertible, we need to calculate the after-tax effect of the interest expense. The tax rate is 30%, so the after-tax interest expense is $400,000 * (1 - 0.30) = $400,000 * 0.70 = $280,000.\n\nThe diluted net income available to common shareholders is $1,360,000 + $280,000 = $1,640,000.\n\nNow, calculate the diluted shares outstanding. We are given that there are 1,000,000 shares of common stock. The convertible bonds can be converted into 300,000 ordinary shares. So, the diluted shares outstanding is 1,000,000 + 300,000 = 1,300,000.\n\nFinally, calculate the diluted earnings per share. This is the diluted net income available to common shareholders divided by the diluted shares outstanding: $1,640,000 / 1,300,000 = 1.26153846154.

From the image, we see that the Term Loan was $55.0 million and Other debt was $13.5 million. The total is $55.0 + $13.5 = $68.5 million.\nNext, we need to determine the interest rates for the \"Term Loan\" and \"Other\" components as of December 29, 2012. According to the provided information, the interest rate on the Term Loan was 1.3% and the weighted average interest rate on Other notes payable was 2.4%.\nThen, we calculate the interest expense for each component based on the rates.\nThe interest expense for the Term Loan is $55.0 * 0.013 = $0.715 million.\nThe interest expense for Other notes payable is $13.5 * 0.024 = $0.324 million.\nNow, we reduce the interest rates by 0.5% (0.005) for both components. The new interest rate for the Term Loan would be 1.3% - 0.5% = 0.8% and for Other, 2.4% - 0.5% = 1.9%.\nThen, we recalculate the interest expense for each component with the reduced interest rates.\nThe new interest expense for the Term Loan is $55.0 * 0.008 = $0.44 million.\nThe new interest expense for Other notes payable is $13.5 * 0.019 = $0.2565 million.\nFinally, we calculate the savings in interest expense for each component by subtracting the new interest expense from the original interest expense.\nSavings for the Term Loan is $0.715 - $0.44 = $0.275 million.\nSavings for Other notes payable is $0.324 - $0.2565 = $0.0675 million.\nThe total savings is $0.275 + $0.0675 = $0.3425 million.\nTherefore, the answer is 0.3425\n",

        "context": "<image 1>\nOn March 17, 2014, we completed the previously announced sale of our Environmental Services business for $100 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on actual working capital conveyed at closing. Cash proceeds from the sale were $89.2 million in the first quarter of 2014, net of transaction related expenses. In addition, $8 million of the sale price was withheld in escrow associated with transaction representations, warranties and indemnities, and is expected to be released over the next two years. As a result of the sale transaction, we recorded a gain on the disposal of the business of $34.0 million ($22.1 million after-tax). All assets, liabilities and results of operations for this business have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nIn December 2013, we completed the acquisition of Terrafirma Roadways (“Terrafirma”), a provider of temporary roadways and worksites based in the United Kingdom, for total cash consideration of $6.8 million, net of cash acquired. Additional consideration up to £1.0 million ($1.6 million) may be payable based on earnings of the business over the 18-month period following the acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Terrafirma had been operating as a partner to the Company since 2008, developing a rental business with DURA-BASE® composite mats, primarily focused in the utility industry in the U.K.\nIn April 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the Company to purchase up to $50.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. In February 2014, our Board of Directors increased the total authorization of the program to $100.0 million, subject to completion of the Environmental Services divesture. These purchases are funded with a combination of cash generated from operations, the sale of the Environmental Services business and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The repurchase program has no specific term. The Company may repurchase shares in the open market or as otherwise determined by management, subject to market conditions, business opportunities and other factors. As part of the share repurchase program, the Company’s management has been authorized to establish trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",

by predecessor companies for which we become responsible as a result of the acquisition . pursuant to their bylaws , pnc and its subsidiaries provide indemnification to directors , officers and , in some cases , employees and agents against certain liabilities incurred as a result of their service on behalf of or at the request of pnc and its subsidiaries . pnc and its subsidiaries also advance on behalf of covered individuals costs incurred in connection with certain claims or proceedings , subject to written undertakings by each such individual to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that the individual is not entitled to indemnification . we generally are responsible for similar indemnifications and advancement obligations that companies we acquire had to their officers , directors and sometimes employees and agents at the time of acquisition . we advanced such costs on behalf of several such individuals with respect to pending litigation or investigations during 2012 . it is not possible for us to determine the aggregate potential exposure resulting from the obligation to provide this indemnity or to advance such costs . visa indemnification our payment services business issues and acquires credit and debit card transactions through visa u.s.a . inc . card association or its affiliates ( visa ) . in october 2007 , visa completed a restructuring and issued shares of visa inc . common stock to its financial institution members ( visa reorganization ) in contemplation of its initial public offering ( ipo ) . as part of the visa reorganization , we received our proportionate share of a class of visa inc . common stock allocated to the us members . prior to the ipo , the us members , which included pnc , were obligated to indemnify visa for judgments and settlements related to the specified litigation . as a result of the acquisition of national city , we became party to judgment and loss sharing agreements with visa and certain other banks . the judgment and loss sharing agreements were designed to apportion financial responsibilities arising from any potential adverse judgment or negotiated settlements related to the specified litigation . in july 2012 , visa funded $ 150 million into their litigation escrow account and reduced the conversion rate of visa b to a shares . we continue to have an obligation to indemnify visa for judgments and settlements for the remaining specified litigation , therefore we may have additional exposure to the specified visa litigation . recourse and repurchase obligations as discussed in note 3 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities , pnc has sold commercial mortgage , residential mortgage and home equity loans directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement . one form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets . commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations we originate , close and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to fnma under fnma 2019s dus program . we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc . under these programs , we generally assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement . at december 31 , 2012 and december 31 , 2011 , the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs was $ 12.8 billion and $ 13.0 billion , respectively . the potential maximum exposure under the loss share arrangements was $ 3.9 billion at december 31 , 2012 and $ 4.0 billion at december 31 , 2011 . we maintain a reserve for estimated losses based upon our exposure . the reserve for losses under these programs totaled $ 43 million and $ 47 million as of december 31 , 2012 and december 31 , 2011 , respectively , and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet . if payment is required under these programs , we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred , although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses . our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the corporate & institutional banking segment . table 154 : analysis of commercial mortgage recourse obligations .\n\n<image 1>\n\nresidential mortgage loan and home equity repurchase obligations while residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis , we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors . these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements . residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations , non-agency securitizations , and loan sale transactions . as discussed in note 3 loans sale and servicing activities and 228 the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k .\n\n\nQuestion: for 2011 and 2012, what were the average commercial mortgage recourse obligations in millions?

Our term loan bears interest at 16% per annum, and our convertible loan bears interest at 10% per annum. In November 2018, we amended the terms of the loan agreements to (i) extend their maturity to June 2020, (ii) waive the conversion features on our convertible loan, and (iii) increase the frequency of interest payments, subject to certain conditions. In January 2019, CEC finalized certain restructuring arrangements, which resulted in a dilution of our ownership interest in CEC and the loss of our representation on the company’s board of managers. As a result of such restructuring, CEC no longer qualified to be accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate balance outstanding on the loans was $23.9 million and was presented within “Prepaid expenses and other current assets.” As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate balance outstanding on the loans was $22.8 million and was presented within “Notes receivable, affiliate.” (2) See Note 9. “Derivative Financial Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our derivative instruments.\n\nQuestion: If the total prepaid expenses and other current assets in 2018 increased by 500 thousand, what will be the percentage change in total prepaid expenses and other current assets from 2018 to 2019? (in percent)\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued) (in thousands, except per share amounts) We account for uncertain tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold to tax positions before recognizing these positions in the financial statements. The reconciliation of our total gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: The unrecognized tax benefits of $13.0 million, if recognized, will impact the Company’s effective tax rate. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. We had $3.0 million and $1.2 million of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect the total amount of tax contingencies will decrease by approximately $3.5 million in 2020 based on statute of limitation expiration. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016.",

Then, the remaining 95% will be Audit services\n    So, the audit service amount is 95x /5= 19x.\n    Total services amount paid to auditors = x + 19x= 20x.\n\n4.   **Relationship of Non-Audit and Total Revenues:**\n    We know that non-audit services (x) constitute 5% (or 0.05) of the total revenue paid to the auditors.\n    So, x = 0.05 * 20x\n    Aggregate auditor fees are 8 times the value of non-audit, hence, x= 8x/20\n\n5.  **Find Audit amount**\n  The information shows that 8x amount makes the payment to the auditors, so 8x is equal to 20x\n    The previous relation is a proportion, and the precise values cannot be identified with this information. There is missing or contradictory information. However, We will assume the correct equation as Total Paid Services=8x\n\n6. **Calculate the Ratio:**\n We are looking for the ratio of the CEO's salary ($120,000) to the amount of audit fees (8x). Because we cannot find 'x' we need to relate the values of the annual salary and the total paid amount. As the statement is contradictory, we cannot reach a precise value. Thus, we will use 8x as the \"Total Paid Amount.\"\n\n    The ratio is, therefore: 120,000 / 8x. With the assumption that x is an unknown \"non-audit\" service.\n\n7. **Final Answer**: The previous relation 120,000/8x can be simplified to 15,000, if we set the unknown as 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 15000.\n",

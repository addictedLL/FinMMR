        "user_input": "The following question context is provided for your reference.\n<image 1>\n A.3.10 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements The negative swing in Corporate items was mainly due to large positive effects in fiscal 2018 – the gain of € 900 million resulting from the transfer of Siemens’ shares in Atos SE to Siemens Pension- Trust e. V. and the gain of € 655 million from the sale of OSRAM Licht AG shares. These effects substantially outweighed a positive result in fiscal 2019 from the measurement of a major asset retirement obligation, which was previously reported in Centrally managed portfolio activities. Severance charges within Corporate items were € 99 million (€ 159 million in fiscal 2018).\n\nQuestion: If the Centrally carried pension expense amounts to (500) million in 2019, what will be the percentage increase / (decrease) from 2018 to 2019? (in percent)\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

( b ) accruing loans have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans . ( c ) includes credit cards and certain small business and consumer credit agreements whose terms have been restructured and are tdrs . however , since our policy is to exempt these loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance as generally these loans are directly charged off in the period that they become 180 days past due , these loans are excluded from nonperforming loans . the following table quantifies the number of loans that were classified as tdrs as well as the change in the recorded investments as a result of the tdr classification during the years ended december 31 , 2012 and 2011 . additionally , the table provides information about the types of tdr concessions . the principal forgiveness tdr category includes principal forgiveness and accrued interest forgiveness . these types of tdrs result in a write down of the recorded investment and a charge-off if such action has not already taken place . the rate reduction tdr category includes reduced interest rate and interest deferral . the tdrs within this category would result in reductions to future interest income . the other tdr category primarily includes postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization , as well as contractual extensions . in some cases , there have been multiple concessions granted on one loan . when there have been multiple concessions granted , the principal forgiveness tdr was prioritized for purposes of determining the inclusion in the table below . for example , if there is principal forgiveness in conjunction with lower interest rate and postponement of amortization , the type of concession will be reported as principal forgiveness . second in priority would be rate reduction . for example , if there is an interest rate reduction in conjunction with postponement of amortization , the type of concession will be reported as a rate reduction . the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k 155 .\n",

        "user_input": "The following question context is provided for your reference.troubled debt restructurings ( tdrs ) a tdr is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties . tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions , principal forgiveness , postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization , extensions , and bankruptcy discharges where no formal reaffirmation was provided by the borrower and therefore a concession has been granted based upon discharge from personal liability , which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral . in those situations where principal is forgiven , the amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged some tdrs may not ultimately result in the full collection of principal and interest , as restructured , and result in potential incremental losses . these potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall alll estimate . the level of any subsequent defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions . once a loan becomes a tdr , it will continue to be reported as a tdr until it is ultimately repaid in full , the collateral is foreclosed upon , or it is fully charged off . we held specific reserves in the alll of $ 587 million and $ 580 million at december 31 , 2012 and december 31 , 2011 , respectively , for the total tdr portfolio . table 71 : summary of troubled debt restructurings in millions dec . 31 dec . 31 .\n\n<image 1>\n\n( a ) pursuant to regulatory guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012 , additional troubled debt restructurings related to changes in treatment of certain loans of $ 366 million in 2012 , net of charge-offs , resulting from bankruptcy where no formal reaffirmation was provided by the borrower and therefore a concession has been granted based upon discharge from personal liability were added to the consumer lending population . the additional tdr population increased nonperforming loans by $ 288 million . charge-offs have been taken where the fair value less costs to sell the collateral was less than the recorded investment of the loan and were $ 128.1 million . of these nonperforming loans , approximately 78% ( 78 % ) were current on their payments at december 31 , 2012 . ( b ) accruing loans have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans . ( c ) includes credit cards and certain small business and consumer credit agreements whose terms have been restructured and are tdrs . however , since our policy is to exempt these loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance as generally these loans are directly charged off in the period that they become 180 days past due , these loans are excluded from nonperforming loans . the following table quantifies the number of loans that were classified as tdrs as well as the change in the recorded investments as a result of the tdr classification during the years ended december 31 , 2012 and 2011 . additionally , the table provides information about the types of tdr concessions . the principal forgiveness tdr category includes principal forgiveness and accrued interest forgiveness . these types of tdrs result in a write down of the recorded investment and a charge-off if such action has not already taken place . the rate reduction tdr category includes reduced interest rate and interest deferral . the tdrs within this category would result in reductions to future interest income . the other tdr category primarily includes postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization , as well as contractual extensions . in some cases , there have been multiple concessions granted on one loan . when there have been multiple concessions granted , the principal forgiveness tdr was prioritized for purposes of determining the inclusion in the table below . for example , if there is principal forgiveness in conjunction with lower interest rate and postponement of amortization , the type of concession will be reported as principal forgiveness . second in priority would be rate reduction . for example , if there is an interest rate reduction in conjunction with postponement of amortization , the type of concession will be reported as a rate reduction . the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k 155 .\n\n\nQuestion: the specific reserves in the alll as of december 31 , 2012 were what percent of the tdr portfolio? Answer to three decimal places.\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

        "user_input": "The following question context is provided for your reference.the total shareholder return of entergy corporation measured over the nine-year period between mr . leonard's appointment as ceo of entergy corporation in january 1999 and the january 24 , 2008 grant date exceeded all of the industry peer group companies as well as all other u.s . utility companies . for additional information regarding stock options awarded in 2008 to each of the named executive officers , see the 2008 grants of plan-based awards table . under the equity ownership plans , all options must have an exercise price equal to the closing fair market value of entergy corporation common stock on the date of grant . in 2008 , entergy corporation implemented guidelines that require an executive officer to achieve and maintain a level of entergy corporation stock ownership equal to a multiple of his or her salary . until an executive officer achieves the multiple ownership position of entergy corporation common stock , the executive officer ( including a named executive officer ) upon exercising any stock option granted on or after january 1 , 2003 , must retain at least 75% ( 75 % ) of the after-tax net profit from such stock option exercise in the form of entergy corporation common stock . entergy corporation has not adopted a formal policy regarding the granting of options at times when it is in possession of material non-public information . however , entergy corporation generally grants options to named executive officers only during the month of january in connection with its annual executive compensation decisions . on occasion , it may grant options to newly hired employees or existing employees for retention or other limited purposes . restricted units restricted units granted under the equity ownership plans represent phantom shares of entergy corporation common stock ( i.e. , non-stock interests that have an economic value equivalent to a share of entergy corporation common stock ) . entergy corporation occasionally grants restricted units for retention purposes , to offset forfeited compensation from a previous employer or other limited purposes . if all conditions of the grant are satisfied , restrictions on the restricted units lift at the end of the restricted period , and a cash equivalent value of the restricted units is paid . the settlement price is equal to the number of restricted units multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation common stock on the date restrictions lift . restricted units are not entitled to dividends or voting rights . restricted units are generally time-based awards for which restrictions lift , subject to continued employment , over a two- to five-year period . in january 2008 , the committee granted mr . denault , entergy corporation's chief financial officer , 24000 restricted units . the committee determined that , in light of the numerous strategic challenges facing entergy ( including the challenges associated with the completion of entergy's pending separation of its non- utility nuclear business ) it was essential that entergy retain mr . denault's continued services as an executive officer of entergy . the committee also took into account the competitive market for chief financial officers and mr . denault's broader role in the leadership of entergy . in determining the size of the grant , the committee consulted its independent consultant to confirm that the grant was consistent with market practices . the committee chose restricted units over other retention instruments because it believes that restricted stock units better align the interest of the officer with entergy corporation's shareholders in terms of growing shareholder value and increasing shareholder returns on equity . the committee also noted , based on the advice of its independent consultant , that such grants are a commonly used market technique for retention purposes . the restricted units will vest on the following dates: .\n\n<image 1>\n\n.\n\n\nQuestion: what portion of the total restricted units will vest in 2011? Answer as percentage to three decimal places.\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

        "question": "The small securities company's research department director, Brian, is in charge of a team that includes 2 junior analysts using the relative value approach to determine a company's worth. Brian informed the 2 junior analysts that using the earnings from the latest 4 quarters may not accurately reflect cyclical companies' long-term earning potential. Therefore, they may find significantly different P/E ratios even though the company's business outlook remains the same. Brian suggested using normalized EPS to solve this issue. Having gathered information about the company throughout the most recent complete cycle, the 2 junior analysts found that the company's balance sheet reveals total assets worth 2100 million and total liabilities of 1200 million. The value of the preferred equity is $120 million, and there are 32 million common shares outstanding. Given this information, what is the company's normalized EPS? Answer to three decimal places.",

        "context": "We are responsible for all future development and commercialization of AL101 and AL102. In consideration for the rights granted under the agreement, we paid BMS a payment of $6 million and issued to BMS 1,125,929 shares of Series A preferred stock valued at approximately $7.3 million, which converted to 562,964 shares of common stock in connection with our initial public offering, or IPO. We are obligated to pay BMS up to approximately $142 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain clinical development or regulatory milestones and up to $50 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones by each product containing the licensed BMS compounds. In addition, we are obligated to pay BMS tiered royalties ranging from a high single-digit to a low teen percentage on worldwide net sales of all products containing the licensed BMS compounds. BMS has the right to terminate the BMS License Agreement in its entirety upon written notice to us (a) for insolvency-related events involving us, (b) for our material breach of the BMS License Agreement if such breach remains uncured for a defined period of time, (c) for our failure to fulfill our obligations to develop or commercialize the BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products not remedied within a defined period of time following written notice by BMS, or (d) if we or our affiliates commence any action challenging the validity, scope, enforceability or patentability of any of the licensed patent rights. We have the right to terminate the BMS License Agreement (a) for convenience upon prior written notice to BMS, the length of notice dependent on whether a BMS Licensed Product has received regulatory approval, (b) upon immediate written notice to BMS for insolvency-related events involving BMS, (c) for BMS’s material breach of the BMS License Agreement if such breach remains uncured for a defined period of time, or (d) on a BMS Licensed Compound-by-BMS Licensed Compound and/or BMS Licensed Product-by-BMS Licensed Product basis upon immediate written notice to BMS if we reasonably determine that there are unexpected safety and public health issues relating to the applicable BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products. Upon termination of the BMS License Agreement in its entirety by us for convenience or by BMS, we grant an exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to BMS under certain of our patent rights that are necessary to develop, manufacture or commercialize BMS Licensed Compounds or BMS Licensed Products. In exchange for such license, BMS must pay us a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of the BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products by it or its affiliates, licensees or sublicensees, provided that the termination occurred after a specified developmental milestone for such BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products. Novartis License Agreements In December 2018, we entered into an evaluation, option and license agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Limited, or Novartis, pursuant to which we granted Novartis an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to research, develop, commercialize and manufacture AL102 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We will continue to supply Novartis quantities of AL102, products containing AL102 and certain other materials for purposes of conducting evaluation studies not comprising human clinical trials during the option period, together with our know-how as may reasonably be necessary in order for Novartis to conduct such evaluation studies. Novartis has agreed to reimburse us for all such expenses. At any time during the option term, Novartis may exercise its option by payment of a low eight figure option exercise fee. If Novartis exercises its option, it will be obligated to pay us up to an additional $245 million upon the achievement of certain clinical development and commercial milestones. In addition, Novartis is obligated to pay us tiered royalties at percentages ranging from a mid-single digit to a low double-digit percentage on worldwide net sales of products licensed under the agreement. The option we granted to Novartis will remain in effect until the earlier of (a) 60 days following the last visit of the last subject in the evaluation studies, (b) the termination of the Novartis Agreement, or (c) 36 months following the delivery by us to Novartis of sufficient amounts of clinical evaluation materials to conduct the anticipated clinical studies. The Novartis Agreement remains in effect until such time as no Novartis Licensed Product is being developed or commercialized by Novartis, its affiliates, or sublicensees (including distributors or commercial partners), unless terminated earlier. We have the right to terminate the Novartis Agreement (a) for Novartis’s material breach if such breach remains uncured for 60 days (such cure period shall be extended for an additional period during which Novartis is making good faith efforts to cure such breach) or (b) for Novartis’s failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or commercialize AL102 and/or the Novartis Licensed Product not remedied within four months following written notice to Novartis. Novartis has the right to terminate the Novartis Agreement (a) in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis for convenience, upon 60 days’ written notice to us, (b) for our material breach if such breach remains uncured for 60 days (such cure period shall be extended for an additional period during which we are making good faith efforts to cure such breach) or (c) upon immediate written notice to us for insolvency-related events involving us.

        "user_input": "The following question context is provided for your reference.We are responsible for all future development and commercialization of AL101 and AL102. In consideration for the rights granted under the agreement, we paid BMS a payment of $6 million and issued to BMS 1,125,929 shares of Series A preferred stock valued at approximately $7.3 million, which converted to 562,964 shares of common stock in connection with our initial public offering, or IPO. We are obligated to pay BMS up to approximately $142 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain clinical development or regulatory milestones and up to $50 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones by each product containing the licensed BMS compounds. In addition, we are obligated to pay BMS tiered royalties ranging from a high single-digit to a low teen percentage on worldwide net sales of all products containing the licensed BMS compounds. BMS has the right to terminate the BMS License Agreement in its entirety upon written notice to us (a) for insolvency-related events involving us, (b) for our material breach of the BMS License Agreement if such breach remains uncured for a defined period of time, (c) for our failure to fulfill our obligations to develop or commercialize the BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products not remedied within a defined period of time following written notice by BMS, or (d) if we or our affiliates commence any action challenging the validity, scope, enforceability or patentability of any of the licensed patent rights. We have the right to terminate the BMS License Agreement (a) for convenience upon prior written notice to BMS, the length of notice dependent on whether a BMS Licensed Product has received regulatory approval, (b) upon immediate written notice to BMS for insolvency-related events involving BMS, (c) for BMS’s material breach of the BMS License Agreement if such breach remains uncured for a defined period of time, or (d) on a BMS Licensed Compound-by-BMS Licensed Compound and/or BMS Licensed Product-by-BMS Licensed Product basis upon immediate written notice to BMS if we reasonably determine that there are unexpected safety and public health issues relating to the applicable BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products. Upon termination of the BMS License Agreement in its entirety by us for convenience or by BMS, we grant an exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to BMS under certain of our patent rights that are necessary to develop, manufacture or commercialize BMS Licensed Compounds or BMS Licensed Products. In exchange for such license, BMS must pay us a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of the BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products by it or its affiliates, licensees or sublicensees, provided that the termination occurred after a specified developmental milestone for such BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products. Novartis License Agreements In December 2018, we entered into an evaluation, option and license agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Limited, or Novartis, pursuant to which we granted Novartis an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to research, develop, commercialize and manufacture AL102 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We will continue to supply Novartis quantities of AL102, products containing AL102 and certain other materials for purposes of conducting evaluation studies not comprising human clinical trials during the option period, together with our know-how as may reasonably be necessary in order for Novartis to conduct such evaluation studies. Novartis has agreed to reimburse us for all such expenses. At any time during the option term, Novartis may exercise its option by payment of a low eight figure option exercise fee. If Novartis exercises its option, it will be obligated to pay us up to an additional $245 million upon the achievement of certain clinical development and commercial milestones. In addition, Novartis is obligated to pay us tiered royalties at percentages ranging from a mid-single digit to a low double-digit percentage on worldwide net sales of products licensed under the agreement. The option we granted to Novartis will remain in effect until the earlier of (a) 60 days following the last visit of the last subject in the evaluation studies, (b) the termination of the Novartis Agreement, or (c) 36 months following the delivery by us to Novartis of sufficient amounts of clinical evaluation materials to conduct the anticipated clinical studies. The Novartis Agreement remains in effect until such time as no Novartis Licensed Product is being developed or commercialized by Novartis, its affiliates, or sublicensees (including distributors or commercial partners), unless terminated earlier. We have the right to terminate the Novartis Agreement (a) for Novartis’s material breach if such breach remains uncured for 60 days (such cure period shall be extended for an additional period during which Novartis is making good faith efforts to cure such breach) or (b) for Novartis’s failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or commercialize AL102 and/or the Novartis Licensed Product not remedied within four months following written notice to Novartis. Novartis has the right to terminate the Novartis Agreement (a) in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis for convenience, upon 60 days’ written notice to us, (b) for our material breach if such breach remains uncured for 60 days (such cure period shall be extended for an additional period during which we are making good faith efforts to cure such breach) or (c) upon immediate written notice to us for insolvency-related events involving us.

        "context": "\n<image 1>\n 15. Income Taxes Nielsen provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law and significantly changed the way the U.S. taxes corporations. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and created a territorial-style taxing system. The TCJA required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred and also created new taxes on certain types of foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the (a) effects on our existing deferred tax balances, and (b) the one-time transition tax. Consequently, our fourth quarter of 2017 and full year 2017 results of operations reflected a non-cash provisional net expense of $104 million. We finalized our accounting for the TCJA in December of 2018 and our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 results of operations reflect, in accordance with SAB 118, a reduction in tax expense of $252 million as an adjustment to the 2017 provisional expense. This was primarily comprised of a net tax benefit of $57 million relating to finalizing the calculation of the transition tax (including withholding taxes) together with a net tax benefit of $195 million associated with the re-measurement of our deferred taxes. The TCJA imposed a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder and was intended to tax earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to be in excess of certain threshold return. As of December 31, 2018, Nielsen made a policy decision and elected to treat taxes on GILTI as a current period expense and have reflected as such within the financial statements as of December 31, 2019 as well. As part of an intercompany restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2018, we transferred certain intellectual property assets between wholly- owned legal entities in non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. As the impact of the transfer was the result of an intra-entity transaction, the resulting gain on the transfer was eliminated for purposes of the consolidated financial statements. The transferring entity recognized a gain on the transfer of assets that was not subject to income tax in its local jurisdiction. In accordance with ASU 2016-16, which the Company adopted in the first quarter of 2018, and as further described in Note 1. “Significant Accounting Policies”, Nielsen recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $193 million. Throughout 2019, ongoing federal and international audits were effectively settled in certain tax jurisdictions and the impact was recorded accordingly the financial statements. The components of income/(loss) before income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates, were: The above amounts for UK and non-UK activities were determined based on the location of the taxing authorities.",

        "user_input": "The following question context is provided for your reference.\n<image 1>\n 15. Income Taxes Nielsen provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law and significantly changed the way the U.S. taxes corporations. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and created a territorial-style taxing system. The TCJA required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred and also created new taxes on certain types of foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the (a) effects on our existing deferred tax balances, and (b) the one-time transition tax. Consequently, our fourth quarter of 2017 and full year 2017 results of operations reflected a non-cash provisional net expense of $104 million. We finalized our accounting for the TCJA in December of 2018 and our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 results of operations reflect, in accordance with SAB 118, a reduction in tax expense of $252 million as an adjustment to the 2017 provisional expense. This was primarily comprised of a net tax benefit of $57 million relating to finalizing the calculation of the transition tax (including withholding taxes) together with a net tax benefit of $195 million associated with the re-measurement of our deferred taxes. The TCJA imposed a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder and was intended to tax earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to be in excess of certain threshold return. As of December 31, 2018, Nielsen made a policy decision and elected to treat taxes on GILTI as a current period expense and have reflected as such within the financial statements as of December 31, 2019 as well. As part of an intercompany restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2018, we transferred certain intellectual property assets between wholly- owned legal entities in non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. As the impact of the transfer was the result of an intra-entity transaction, the resulting gain on the transfer was eliminated for purposes of the consolidated financial statements. The transferring entity recognized a gain on the transfer of assets that was not subject to income tax in its local jurisdiction. In accordance with ASU 2016-16, which the Company adopted in the first quarter of 2018, and as further described in Note 1. “Significant Accounting Policies”, Nielsen recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $193 million. Throughout 2019, ongoing federal and international audits were effectively settled in certain tax jurisdictions and the impact was recorded accordingly the financial statements. The components of income/(loss) before income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates, were: The above amounts for UK and non-UK activities were determined based on the location of the taxing authorities.\n\nQuestion: What would the percentage change in the loss before income taxes and equity in net income/(loss) of affiliates from 2018 to 2019 be if the amount in 2019 was (700) million instead? (in percent)\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

        "user_input": "The following question context is provided for your reference.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report 127 receivables from customers receivables from customers primarily represent margin loans to prime and retail brokerage clients that are collateralized through a pledge of assets maintained in clients 2019 brokerage accounts which are subject to daily minimum collateral requirements . in the event that the collateral value decreases , a maintenance margin call is made to the client to provide additional collateral into the account . if additional collateral is not provided by the client , the client 2019s position may be liquidated by the firm to meet the minimum collateral requirements . lending-related commitments the firm uses lending-related financial instruments , such as commitments ( including revolving credit facilities ) and guarantees , to meet the financing needs of its customers . the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparties draw down on these commitments or the firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees , and the counterparties subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts . in the firm 2019s view , the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the firm 2019s likely actual future credit exposure or funding requirements . in determining the amount of credit risk exposure the firm has to wholesale lending-related commitments , which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments , the firm has established a 201cloan-equivalent 201d amount for each commitment ; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is expected , based on average portfolio historical experience , to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor . the loan-equivalent amount of the firm 2019s lending- related commitments was $ 212.4 billion and $ 216.5 billion as of december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively . clearing services the firm provides clearing services for clients entering into securities and derivative transactions . through the provision of these services the firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by central counterparties ( 201cccps 201d ) . where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement . for further discussion of clearing services , see note 29 . derivative contracts in the normal course of business , the firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities . derivatives enable customers to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates , currencies and other markets . the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure . the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed . for otc derivatives the firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty . for exchange- traded derivatives ( 201cetd 201d ) , such as futures and options and 201ccleared 201d over-the-counter ( 201cotc-cleared 201d ) derivatives , the firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant ccp . where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative transactions through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements . for further discussion of derivative contracts , counterparties and settlement types , see note 6 . the following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented . derivative receivables .\n\n<image 1>\n\nderivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 59.7 billion and $ 79.0 billion at december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively . these amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts , after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 16.6 billion and $ 19.6 billion at december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . the decrease in derivative receivables was predominantly driven by declines in interest rate derivatives , commodity derivatives , foreign exchange derivatives and equity derivatives due to market movements , maturities and settlements related to client- driven market-making activities in cib. .\n\n\nQuestion: interest rate derivatives made up how much of the net total derivatives for 2015?

The most significant provision reduced the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018. We remeasured the applicable deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse. As a result, the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted which resulted in an expense for income taxes of $7.1 million which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance in 2017. The Tax Act contains several base broadening provisions that became effective on January 1, 2018, that did not have a material impact on 2018 and 2019 earnings. Deferred tax asset (liability) is comprised of the following (in thousands): We have determined it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized.

As a result, the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted which resulted in an expense for income taxes of $7.1 million which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance in 2017. The Tax Act contains several base broadening provisions that became effective on January 1, 2018, that did not have a material impact on 2018 and 2019 earnings. Deferred tax asset (liability) is comprised of the following (in thousands): We have determined it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.\n\nQuestion: What would be the percentage change in the stock options and warrants between 2018 and 2019 if the amount in 2019 is increased by 10%? (in percent)\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended May 31, 2019 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock repurchase program:\n\nQuestion: How much was the Average Price Paid per Share from February 2019 to April 2019 if the total number of shares purchased in February 2019 was the same as that for April 2019 and the Average Price Paid per Share was 88.91?\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

        "question": "Marston Marble Corporation is considering a merger with the Conroy Concrete Company. Conroy is a publicly traded company, and its beta is 1.30. Conroy has been barely profitable, so it has paid an average of only 20% in taxes during the lastseveral years. In addition, it uses little debt; its target ratio is just 25%, with the cost of debt 9%. If the acquisition were made, Marston would operate Conroy as a separate, wholly owned subsidiary. Marston would pay taxes on a consolidated basis, and the tax rate would therefore increase to 35%. Marston also would increase the debt capitalization in the Conroy subsidiary to wd = 40%, for a total of $22.27 million in debt by the end of Year 4, and pay 9.5% on the debt. Marston's acquisition department estimates that Conroy, if acquired, would generate the following free cash flows and interest expenses (in millions of dollars) in Years 1-5: <image 1> In Year 5, Conroy's interest expense would be based on its beginning-of-year (that is, the end-of-Year-4) debt, and in subsequent years both interest expense and free cash flows are projected to grow at a rate of 6%. These cash flows include all acquisition effects. Marston's cost of equity is 10.5%, its beta is 1.0, and its cost of debt is 9.5%. The risk-free rate is 6%, and the market risk premium is 4.5%. What is the dollar value of Conroy's operations (in millions)? Answer to two decimal places.",

Conroy has been barely profitable, so it has paid an average of only 20% in taxes during the lastseveral years. In addition, it uses little debt; its target ratio is just 25%, with the cost of debt 9%. If the acquisition were made, Marston would operate Conroy as a separate, wholly owned subsidiary. Marston would pay taxes on a consolidated basis, and the tax rate would therefore increase to 35%. Marston also would increase the debt capitalization in the Conroy subsidiary to wd = 40%, for a total of $22.27 million in debt by the end of Year 4, and pay 9.5% on the debt. Marston's acquisition department estimates that Conroy, if acquired, would generate the following free cash flows and interest expenses (in millions of dollars) in Years 1-5: <image 1> In Year 5, Conroy's interest expense would be based on its beginning-of-year (that is, the end-of-Year-4) debt, and in subsequent years both interest expense and free cash flows are projected to grow at a rate of 6%. These cash flows include all acquisition effects. Marston's cost of equity is 10.5%, its beta is 1.0, and its cost of debt is 9.5%. The risk-free rate is 6%, and the market risk premium is 4.5%. What is the dollar value of Conroy's operations (in millions)? Answer to two decimal places.\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the given question.\n",

A total of 500,000 shares were initially reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Plan was amended several times since then to eventually increase the authorized shares to 2,500,000 as of December 31, 2019. A total of 1,624,221 shares of common stock underlying options were outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Company had 236,614 remaining shares available to grant under the Plan at December 31, 2019. The Plan allows the Company to grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, or restricted stock. The incentive stock options are exercisable for up to ten years, at an option price per share not less than the fair market value on the date the option is granted. The incentive stock options are limited to persons who are regular full-time employees of the Company at the date of the grant of the option. Non-qualified options may be granted to any person, including, but not limited to, employees, independent agents, consultants and attorneys, who the Company’s Board or Compensation Committee believes have contributed, or will contribute, to the success of the Company. Non-qualified options may be issued at option prices of less than fair market value on the date of grant and may be exercisable for up to ten years from date of grant. The option vesting schedule for options granted is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of the grant. The Plan provides for accelerated vesting of unvested options if there is a change in control, as defined in the Plan. The compensation cost that has been charged against income related to options for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $1,687,745 and $1,317,904, respectively. No income tax benefit was recognized in the income statement and no compensation was capitalized in any of the years presented.

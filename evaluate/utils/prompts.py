Your task is to analyze a given financial problem and its context, and generate a concise and precise retrieval query that can be used to search a financial function library for relevant functions.

        1. Intent Recognition: Identify the core intent of the problem (e.g., calculating present value, estimating risk, optimizing portfolio).
        2. Applicability: Consider the scope and applicability of the function (e.g., time period, asset type, market conditions).
        3. Constraints: Include any constraints or limitations relevant to the problem (e.g., input data format, computational complexity).
        4. Generalization: Ensure the query is generalized enough to match multiple potential functions but specific enough to exclude irrelevant ones.
        Your output should be a single, well-structured retrieval query that captures the essence of the problem and its requirements. The query should be concise, clear, and suitable for vector-based similarity search against a financial function library.
